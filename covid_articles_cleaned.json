Here is a breakdown for who should expect a check, as well as how and when they're going to get it. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. One of the cornerstones of the Senate coronavirus stimulus package is the direct payment of money from the federal government to American individuals and families. In the middle of the bill's hundreds of pages are details regarding exactly who can expect to receive money\u00a0and how much they can expect. Here is a breakdown. SENATE PASSES CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS\u00a0PACKAGE, HEADED TO HOUSE Who is eligible? The bill makes clear that everyone is eligible except for nonresident aliens and those who can be used as the basis for deductions for another person. \"Seniors, veterans, the unemployed and low-income Americans would be eligible too,\" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said Wednesday. The bill text indicates those who receive social security can collect checks:\u00a0For those not required to file 2018 or 2019 tax returns because of social security benefits, tax returns aren\u2019t required to claim the money --\u00a0the government can use information from a Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement, or Form RRB-1099, Social Security Equivalent Benefit Statement. With that in mind, here is how much people can expect to get. People filing individually People who file their taxes as individuals are eligible for payments up to $1,200, but that decreases for people who earn an adjusted gross income of\u00a0more than $75,000 a year.\u00a0The bill says that the payment is reduced by five percent of every dollar above that mark, or $50 for every $1,000 above $75,000. What that ultimately means is that for people who make more than $75,000 the payment is less the higher their earnings are, with it being reduced to zero for those who make $99,000 or more. People filing jointly Couples who file\u00a0a joint tax return are eligible for a payment of up to $2,400, plus and additional $500 per child. However, that amount decreases for couples whose adjusted gross income is more than $150,000 in a year at the same rate of 5 percent of every dollar above that mark. This translates to less money the more people make, with it being reduced to zero for joint filers without children who earn $198,000 or more. People filing as heads of households People who file as heads of households are eligible for payments of up to $1,200, but that amount is increased by $500 per child. That amount is reduced for people who earn an adjusted gross income of more than $112,000 a year. The extent to which it is decreased, of course, depends on how many children they have, as illustrated by the chart above. The following chart, courtesy of the Tax Foundation, illustrates how it all works. Image courtesy of the Tax Foundation  Income is based on people's tax filings for 2019, but if they have not filed for that year, then their filing for 2018 applies. \"[I]f the individual has not filed a tax return for such individual's first taxable year beginning in 2018,\" the bill says, the information should be used for 2019 provided in their SSA-1099 or RRB-1099 Social Security Benefit Statements. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When and how are payments made? Payments,\u00a0according to the bill, will be made \u201cas rapidly as possible\u201d and no later than Dec. 31, 2020. They will be made via direct deposit to an account that the person has authorized for tax refunds or\u00a0federal payments on or after Jan. 1, 2018. Notice will be sent to the\u00a0person\u2019s last known address within 15 days of payment informing them of the method and amount of payment. A phone number will also be provided so people can call the IRS in the event they did not receive it.

        "text": "Games\nCorrespondent Jonathan Serrie has more from Atlanta on 'Special Report'  Members of the progressive \"Squad\" in the House on Thursday introduced their own bill to send $2,000 stimulus\u00a0checks to Americans after President Trump this week demanded the $600 checks included in Congress' stimulus deal be increased to that number.\u00a0 The legislation was spearheaded by Reps. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass.;\u00a0Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.; Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.; Ilhan Omar, D-Minn.; and Pramila Jayapal D-Wash. It came after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the House will meet on Monday to vote on stand-alone legislation for $2,000 stimulus checks.\u00a0 \"This holiday season, families are\u00a0being forced to make incredibly difficult decisions, such as whether they should keep their lights on or buy groceries,\" Tlaib said in a statement. \"Providing $2,000 survival checks would give those struggling right now a lifeline as we continue to fight to defeat COVID-19. It\u2019s time for Trump to stop bluffing and get the members of his party in line\u00a0so that the government can provide this\u00a0long-overdue relief to\u00a0people across the country during this time of great need.\" Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat from Michigan, left, speaks during a panel discussion during a campaign event for Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont and 2020 presidential candidate, in Clive, Iowa, U.S., on Friday, Jan. 31, 2020. Tlaib was one of the co-sponsors of a bill for $2,000 stimulus checks that was introduced Thursday. Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images  Added Pressley: \"We\u2019ve been fighting all along for robust survival checks to help people meet their most basic needs, and the broad support that has emerged is a testament to the power of the people and the urgency of this moment. $2,000 in direct cash assistance will help families weather the crisis while we continue fighting for additional relief that meets the scale and scope of the hurt so many are feeling. Let\u2019s get it done.\" TOP DEM UNVEILS BILL TO INCREASE COVID STIMULUS CHECKS TO $2,000 AFTER TRUMP DEMAND The bill from the \"Squad\"\u00a0members is different from a separate bill introduced by Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., that would do essentially the same thing. Neal's bill would simply change the numbers in the coronavirus stimulus bill to say $2,000 instead of $600, and would only come into effect if the stimulus and government funding package Congress recently sent to the president is signed into law. The printed legislation\u00a0was flown to Mar-a-Lago, where Trump is spending Christmas.\u00a0 The \"Squad\"\u00a0bill however is independent of the rest of the stimulus and directly amends the Internal Revenue Code's wording as it stands currently after the stimulus Congress passed earlier this year. Therefore that bill\u00a0could be enacted on its own.\u00a0 Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., is one of the sponsors of a bill to send Americans $2,000 stimulus checks independent of the other coronavirus-related aid. (Reuters)  No matter what legislation the House passes on stimulus checks, it faces a tough road ahead in the Senate. Republicans in the upper chamber have been on a different page than the president throughout the coronavirus stimulus efforts and widely opposed $2,000 checks. TOP DEMOCRATS SEE $900B COVID RELIEF PACKAGE AS JUST THE BEGINNING Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said, \"I would be surprised if we dealt with\" a Democrat push for $2,000 checks.\u00a0 Democrats will vote on Monday after 3 p.m. on bigger stimulus checks and will also vote to override Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act. House Republicans blocked a Democrat effort to provide the $2,000 checks on the floor Thursday.\u00a0 Democrats, meanwhile, blocked a GOP effort to address the other part of Trump's twofold objections to the government spending package \u2013\u00a0foreign aid. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., accused Democrats of having \"selective hearing\" for only wanting to address the checks and not the foreign aid.\u00a0 Trump's apparent decision not to sign the massive coronavirus stimulus and government funding package that lawmakers sent to him\u00a0puts the government at risk of shutting down yet again.\u00a0 The government is currently operating on a one-week stopgap bill that was meant only to give Trump time to sign the funding package, which members of Congress say they'd been assured he would. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump could also potentially use a rare\u00a0pocket veto on the legislation. The current congressional session ends on Jan. 3, which means if Trump does not sign or veto the spending and stimulus before then it essentially vanishes into thin air, bringing Congress back to square one.\u00a0 Some in Congress are still hoping Trump will sign the government spending and coronavirus aid package. But it's not clear exactly what the president's plans are.\u00a0 \"I have no idea what he plans to do,\" Blunt said Thursday.\u00a0 Fox News' Jason Donner contributed to this report.\u00a0 Tyler Olson is a Capitol Hill Producer for Fox News in Washington, D.C.

        "text": "Games\nBen Domenech, Leo Terrell, Carley Shimkus and Rachel Campos-Duffy weigh in 'The Big Sunday Show' Senate Democrats passed a sweeping coronavirus\u00a0relief package on a party-line basis Saturday, sending the nearly $2 trillion measure back over to the House, after which it will head\u00a0to President Biden's desk for his signature. The House is expected to vote Tuesday on the Senate's version of the bill, which includes several key changes from the legislation initially approved by the House \u2014 including stricter eligibility limits for the $1,400 stimulus check and no $15\u00a0minimum wage increase.\u00a0 House Democrats aim to approve the measure in time for Biden to sign it into law before Sunday, when two federal jobless aid programs expire, leaving millions of Americans without an income.\u00a0 Take a closer at the specific provisions included in the American Rescue Plan, and the measures that didn't make the cut. DEMS WANT TO INCLUDE $3,600 CHILD TAX CREDIT IN COVID RELIEF BILL: HERE'S WHO QUALIFIES Stimulus checks:\u00a0Most Americans will receive a third stimulus check worth up to\u00a0$1,400. The money would be in addition to the $600 check sent out this month, bringing the total payment amount to $2,000. The legislation expands check eligibility to include adult dependents who were previously excluded from receiving the money, including college students and individuals with disabilities.\u00a0 As with previous rounds, Americans who earn more than the threshold line will still receive a partial check. But the money will phase out faster: Individuals making $80,000 a year or more and couples making $160,000 a year, or higher, no longer qualify for the checks. That means individuals earning between\u00a0$80,000 and $100,000, and couples earning between $160,000 and $200,000, are newly excluded from a partial check under the legislation. Extend supplemental\u00a0unemployment aid:\u00a0The relief measure extends supplemental unemployment benefits by $300 a week through Sept. 6. It also adds a new provision that makes the first $10,200 of the 2020 benefits non-taxable for households earning less than $150,000.\u00a0 Temporary tax credit expansion:\u00a0The stimulus bill includes a significant expansion of the\u00a0child tax credit, which is currently $2,000 per child. Under the proposed changes, most American parents would receive $3,000 a year for every child ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 a year for every child under age 6. The expanded amounts would taper off\u00a0once income hits $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples. Aid for state and local governments:\u00a0State, local and territorial governments would be provided with $350 billion in emergency funding to help them keep front-line workers employed and aid with vaccine distribution, COVID-19 testing, reopening schools and \"maintaining other vital services.\" DEMS WANT TO INCLUDE $3,600 CHILD TAX CREDIT IN COVID RELIEF BILL: HERE'S WHO QUALIFIES Minimum wage increase:\u00a0Democrats wanted to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour and end the tipped minimum wage and sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities in the relief bill. But the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan rule keeper, determined that a pay floor increase\u00a0is\u00a0not compliant with rules under budget reconciliation, the tactic\u00a0that Democrats are using\u00a0to fast-track the stimulus bill\u00a0with a simple majority in both chambers. Lawmakers also dropped a last-minute plan to raise the minimum wage through a corporate\u00a0tax penalty amid concerns that its inclusion could delay the bill's passage. $400 a week unemployment benefits:\u00a0House Democrats wanted to increase the jobless aid to $400 a week through Aug. 29. But Senate Democrats agreed to lower the benefit by $100 a week after pushback from Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.\u00a0 \"We have reached a compromise that enables the economy to rebound quickly while also protecting those receiving unemployment benefits from being hit with [an] unexpected tax bill next year,\"\u00a0Manchin said in a statement late Friday. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE $140 million for a California rail project:\u00a0A subway extension through downtown San Jose was set to receive about $141 million under the relief bill that passed in the House.\u00a0 But the Senate Parliamentarian ruled that because the transportation project is still in the pilot phase,\u00a0it does not mean the requirements for inclusion, Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said last week.\u00a0 Senate drafters also removed $1.5 million in funding to maintain and operate a bridge\u00a0connecting Canada and the United States in upstate New York.

The federal government doled out $783.5 million for incarcerated individuals as part of the American Rescue Plan, Fox News has learned.\u00a0 In response to a public records request from conservative group American Crossroads, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) revealed that the money flowed to 560,000 individuals who were incarcerated for the full tax year 2020. Passed in March, the American Rescue Plan granted $1,400 in stimulus money to people making less than $75,000 per year. \"Earlier this year, every single Senate Democrat voted to give stimulus checks to violent criminals in prison,\" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said in a statement to Fox News.\u00a0 \"Sending cash to murderers and rapists in prison has nothing to do with solving the pandemic or improving the economy. Now, the same people who sent hundreds of millions of dollars as gifts to these inmates want to spend trillions more in an even bigger and more partisan bill.\"\u00a0 Sens. Cotton and Bill Cassidy, R-La., attempted to exclude prisoners in March but that amendment failed on a party-line vote.\u00a0 COVID RELIEF BILL OFFERS CONVICTED MURDERERS STIMULUS CHECKS, COTTON SLAMS The $1,400 payout was in addition to $1,200 and $600 checks offered as part of the previous coronavirus relief legislation. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., criticized the measure, saying it would harm Black and Brown families. \"Given the stark racial disparities in our criminal justice system, this would cause the most harm to Black and brown families and communities already harmed by mass incarceration,\" he said from the\u00a0Senate floor. \"Children should not be forced to go hungry because a parent is incarcerated.\" Although the Trump administration attempted to block the initial payments from flowing to prisoners, those efforts were eventually halted by a federal judge who noted that the legislation itself didn't exclude prisoners.

        "text": "Games\nSen. Pat Toomey, R-Penna., on status of coronavirus relief bill. President Trump doubled down on his demand Friday for increased coronavirus-related stimulus checks to working-class Americans. Trump again tweeted his demand for $2,000 checks rather than the $600 proposed in the mammoth spending bill approved by Congress earlier this week. \"Made many calls and had meetings at Trump International in Palm Beach, Florida. Why would politicians not want to give people $2000, rather than only $600? It wasn\u2019t their fault, it was China,\" the president wrote on Twitter. \"Give our people the money!\" Trump and other critics of the bill have deemed the bill\u00a05,500 pages of pork-barrel spending rather than an earnest attempt to help struggling Americans beset by gubernatorial economic lockdowns and the overall drop in commerce ushered in by the pandemic. CORONAVIRUS RELIEF LEGISLATION INCLUDES $10M FOR 'GENDER PROGRAMS' IN PAKISTAN \"It\u2019s called the Covid relief bill but it has almost nothing to do with Covid,\" the president said Thursday, going on to point to a provision in the bill that would triple the $600 check for family members of illegal aliens -- to $1,800: \"This is far more than the Americans are given,\" he said. Libertarians and progressives have also found unusual common ground in their opposition to the legislation. The progressive \"Squad\" of progressive representatives called for an amendment that provides the $2,000 payments. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., a member of \"The Squad\" from Boston, expressed such sentiment in a tweet appearing to praise Trump for taking a \"hard line\u00a0in support of what Progressives have been fighting for.\" But she called the president the \"Occupant of the White House\" and accused him of trying to \"spite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Trump has been upset with McConnell because of\u00a0the Kentuckian's reticence to support\u00a0challenges to the 2020 election tallies. \"Honestly, whatever gets my constituents survival checks,\" Pressley remarked.\u00a0 On the other side of the aisle, one of the president's frequent defenders, retiring GOP Rep. Peter King of New York wrote\u00a0a lengthy Facebook post explaining that the line items in the bill objected to by the president were \"specifically requested by the Trump administration.\" \"You got that -- every item,\" King wrote. \"That includes aid to Egypt, Pakistan, Burma, Sudan and Central America, and funding for the Smithsonian.\" \"Additionally it was totally deceptive for the president to say that Congress failed to provide assistance to restaurants. The truth is that [Queens Democratic] Congresswoman Grace Meng and I co-sponsored legislation to give direct grants to restaurants but the Trump Administration adamantly refused to assist restaurants.\" King and Meng's state of New York, along with\u00a0Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, and California among others.\u00a0has been hit hard by economic \"shutdowns\" imposed by the state governments, which have in turn crippled the restaurant and entertainment industries. In his post, King made it clear that he was not intentionally critiquing Trump with his remarks, applauding his fellow New Yorker's record, especially on law and order. \"Believe me I don\u2019t take any satisfaction in pointing out how wrong the President is. I have strongly supported the President and worked hard for his re-election,\" he said. \"I am particularly indebted to him for his outstanding leadership in stopping MS-13\u2019s killing rampage on Long Island, crushing the ISIS caliphate in the Middle East and standing with the police.\" King said he felt the need to \"set the record straight\" after watching Republicans who supported the bill\u00a0getting attacked by \"rabid, uninformed comments.\"\u00a0 On Wednesday,\u00a0Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., urged Trump to go ahead and sign the $908 billion relief package, echoing King's sentiment that the administration was indeed closely involved in negotiations with Congress. \"We negotiated the bill, and\u00a0the president\u2019s people were\u00a0intimately involved every step\u00a0of the way,\" the Allentown, Pa., lawmaker told Fox News' \"The Daily Briefing.\"\u00a0Treasury\u00a0\"Secretary Steve Mnuchin was\u00a0arguably one of the most\u00a0involved people in this whole\u00a0negotiation.\" Toomey, a noted fiscal hawk, added that he too has many\u00a0issues with some of the bill's expenditures. \"There are a lot of provisions I\u00a0don\u2019t like,\" Toomey said. \"There are provisions that the\u00a0Democrats don\u2019t like. This is what we were able to get\u00a0to, and my suggestion would be\u00a0let\u2019s pass this and get this\u00a0signed, let's get this\u00a0into law, and we can\u00a0have an ongoing discussion about\u00a0whether there should be\u00a0additional direct payments or\u00a0not.\" In addition, conservative Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., succinctly summed up what he saw as the overarching issue with the legislation causing the sudden political turmoil: \"I didn\u2019t vote for the bill but I respect the people who did vote for it,\" he tweeted. \"We were given two bad choices. (1) Fund everything or (2) Fund nothing. I hope my colleagues will be forthright and admit that this is legislative malpractice. One bill should cover one topic, not 1,000.\" Fox News' Joshua Nelson and Dom Calicchio contributed to this report.

        "text": "Games\nLucie Mitchell, mom of two teenagers, and Tom Kersting, psychotherapist and dad of two, discuss how the pandemic has affected teens\u2019 mental health on \u2018Fox &amp; Friends First.\u2019 Substance abuse has surged across the U.S. as a result of coronavirus-induced isolation, but there is also a correlation between stimulus payments and overdoses, experts say. County officials in Virginia, Tennessee, Ohio, Minnesota and other states have reported recent spikes in fatal and non-fatal overdoses, as well as emergency room visits. The third round of stimulus payments was approved March 17. \"We definitely believe that there\u2019s a correlation between the recent stimulus checks that were sent out and\u00a0the overdoses we\u2019re seeing right now,\" Lauren Cummings, executive director of the Northern Shenandoah Valley Substance Abuse Coalition, told Fox News.\u00a0\"We saw an increase in overdoses after the first round of stimulus payouts. We annually see an increase in overdoses following tax returns.\" The Northwest Virginia Regional Drug and Gang Task Force\u00a0on March 23 reported three fatal overdoses and 13 non-fatal overdoses in the prior\u00a0week. The stimulus payments, on top of isolation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, have been a \"deadly combination,\" according to Cummings. \"It\u2019s kind of an irony,\" Gerry Schmidt, chief operating officer at Valley HealthCare System in West Virginia, which serves as a substance abuse counseling center, told Fox News. \"I mean, a stimulus check you shouldn\u2019t put in the bank, if you think about it. Stimulus checks are supposed to help the economy and help people move forward through a tough time.\" BOY, 2, DIES AFTER EATING FENTYNAL MOM BOUGHT WITH STIMULUS CHECK, COPS SAY The northern Virginia region saw 53 fatal overdoses in 2020 and 202 non-fatal overdoses -- a record for the area, despite being one of the few regions in the U.S. that saw a decrease in overdoses between 2017 and 2018. \"We always say that addiction is a disease of isolation, and the opposite of that is connection. Unfortunately, with support group meetings being moved to virtual platforms, people were just not feeling a connection and were forced into isolation, which led many to relapse,\" Schmidt said. It\u2019s not just Northern Virginia. Cummings\u2019 coalition is part of the Drug Enforcement Administration\u2019s (DEA's) Washington-Baltimore High-Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program.

(Photo by ALEX EDELMAN/AFP via Getty Images)  \"I reached out to the director there as well as some of my other local contacts in the area after we saw the increase this week, and across the board, everybody is seeing the same thing and attributing it to the stimulus checks,\" Cummings said.\u00a0 Emergency room visits for alcohol withdrawals are increasing, too.\u00a0 Schmidt similarly said the combination of COVID-19 isolation, remote support groups, stimulus payments and increased availability of fentanyl has created an unusual set of circumstances causing an uptick in overdoses. INDIANAPOLIS MAN WHO KILLED 4 OVER STIMULUS MONEY ADMITTED TO SLAYINGS IN CHILLING DETAIL: POLICE After 50 years of helping people suffering from drug abuse, it\u2019s becoming more and more common for drugs to be laced with unknown substances, which puts people at a greater risk of overdosing,\u00a0Schmidt added. Both Schmidt and Cummings called the circumstances \"a perfect storm\" for increased drug abuse. \"You\u2019ve got an influx of cash and a decrease in the street cost of heroin, an increase in the availability of fentanyl, and so, all of those things coming together just creates a melting pot of possibility,\" Schmidt said.

(Photo by Gary Hershorn/Getty Images)  West Virginia has seen a \"huge increase\" in depression and anxiety, and he doesn\u2019t think people\u2019s fears will disperse easily, even as COVID-19 cases decrease. People who have been vaccinated \"are still afraid to go out,\" he said. COVID-19 \"has been too politicized, and it\u2019s grown along the political lines rather than the medical lines,\" he said. The politicization, on top of the personal losses associated with COVID-19, whether that be the loss of family and friends or jobs and income, has created a large amount of suffering. DEA CHEMIST ON FENTYNAL GETTING INTO THE US: 'WHERE DOES IT END?' Schmidt added that West Virginia \"made a mistake\" in paying people \"to stay home\" rather than only encouraging people with COVID-19 to stay home because of how the state \"dealt with unemployment.\" \"People have turned to alcohol and/or drugs during this time because -- well, one, they\u2019re either fearful and looking for relief; boredom; social isolation -- all those things do factor in,\" he said. There are steps people suffering from addiction can take to prevent misuse of their stimulus checks, according to both experts.

(JT Wampler/The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette via AP)  \"We hope that folks can recognize that this money is a trigger for them,\" Cummings said, \"and if they do recognize that, we recommend that they either have a family member hold the funding for them or put it into an account that they don\u2019t have [direct] access to right away.\" People should put their money toward useful purchases or investments, such as cars,\u00a0or consider giving it to people who could use financial support, Schmidt said. He added that despite support groups going virtual and fears of gathering in person, Valley HealthCare Systems has seen an increase in\u00a0people seeking help for substance addiction. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"They\u2019re up against some tough odds right now,\" Schmidt said of people with substance addiction. \"But...we have not seen a decrease in the request for or the demand for services throughout this whole last year. If anything, we\u2019ve seen an increase.\" While an increase in requests for help does not necessarily point to a positive trend, he explained that people \"aren\u2019t afraid\" to seek help, which is a positive development he\u2019s seen throughout the past year.\u00a0 \"In general, people feel like they\u2019ve been given permission to seek help,\" he added.

        "text": "Games\nAmericans will soon receive a much-needed handout of up to $1,200 per person from the coronavirus stimulus bill. Here are some answers to your most pressing questions about how Americans will receive their stimulus money. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. With payments from\u00a0the coronavirus stimulus package\u00a0expected to reach\u00a0American individuals and families as soon as this week, here is a breakdown of who will get them and how. How do I get my money? Do I need to apply to receive my payment? The stimulus checks, much like a tax refund, will be handled by the Internal Revenue Service. If you have filed your taxes electronically, the money can be transferred to your bank account via direct deposit. If you have filed a paper copy of your taxes or have closed the bank account used to receive previous tax refunds, the government will send a check in the mail. If you have moved since you last filed your taxes, remember to submit a change of address form, which normally takes four to six weeks to process, in order to have the check sent to the correct residence. Alternatively, the House Ways and Means Committee said that the Treasury Department plans on setting up an online portal where people can submit their bank information to set up direct deposits instead of getting checks in the mail. The best way to make sure your money arrives soon\u00a0is to file your 2019\u00a0tax return as quickly as possible. This is especially true for people who lost a job in the last year as this could put you in a position to qualify to receive more money. How will I know when I\u2019ve received the stimulus money? According to the text of the bill, Americans will receive a note in the mail \u2013 another reason to update your address information \u2013\u00a0informing them of where the payment ended up and in what form it was made. The paper notice should arrive no more than a few weeks after the money was disbursed. If you\u2019re having trouble locating the money \u2013 either in your bank account or via a check in the mail \u2013 there will be information regarding how to contact the IRS in the note mailed to you. What if I don\u2019t have an income or haven\u2019t filed a tax return? While most Americans are required to file a tax return, certain low-wage workers and people with no income will need to fill out a 1040-EZ form. While you\u2019re not legally required to do so, the short form could help you get your stimulus check from the government. I receive Social Security or disability payments, do I get a check? I\u2019m a veteran, what about me? I live abroad, can I still get a check? The answer to all those questions is yes, although Americans living abroad will still have to meet the income requirements and have a Social Security number. Social Security recipients who do not file tax returns will be able to receive their payments based on\u00a0information taken from\u00a0SSA-1099 and RRB-1099 forms. According to the bill, only non-resident aliens and those who can be claimed by someone else as a dependent are not eligible, but parents claiming children as dependents get an extra $500 per child. How much can people expect to get? People who file their taxes as individuals are eligible for payments up to $1,200, and couples who file jointly are eligible for up to $2,400 plus an\u00a0additional $500 per child under the age of 17. The amount decreases for individuals who earn an adjusted gross income of\u00a0more than $75,000 and couples who earn more than $150,000 a year, by $5 for every $100 in income above those marks. This means the payment is less the higher their earnings are, with it being reduced to zero for individuals\u00a0who make $99,000 or more and couples who make $198,000 or more People who file as heads of household\u00a0are eligible for payments of up to $1,200 plus $500 per child under 17. That amount is reduced for people who earn an adjusted gross income of more than $112,000 a year. The extent to which it is decreased depends on how many children they have. Payment amounts may also be offset by any past due child support payments that have been reported to the Treasury Department. For a more detailed look at the payment amounts, click here. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Is the stimulus payment considered taxable income? No. The payments\u00a0do not count as taxable income. Similarly, they do not count for determining eligibility for federal programs like Supplemental Security Income. Fox News' Andrew O'Reilly contributed to this report.

        "text": "Games\nDemocratic strategist Robert Patillo and political analyst Ron Meyer weigh in on Trump's involvement with new stimulus package. The House of Representatives on Monday will vote on a bill to send $2,000 stimulus checks to Americans in lieu of the $600 checks included in the coronavirus stimulus and government funding package President Trump signed Sunday night.\u00a0 The vote will come\u00a0after Trump for the better part of a week railed against the size of the checks and the amount of foreign aid included in the massive combination of two legislative accords that lawmakers sent to his desk. The Monday vote won't address the \"pork\" that Trump has said he wishes to cut -- despite the fact he requested much of it in his budget. But it will force GOP House members to go on the record on whether\u00a0to increase the price tag on the stimulus checks after the president demanded\u00a0they do so.\u00a0 \"I simply want to get our great people $2000, rather than the measly $600 that is now in the bill,\" Trump said in a tweet Saturday. \"Now, the President must immediately call on Congressional Republicans to end their obstruction and to join him and Democrats in support of our stand-alone legislation to increase direct payment checks to $2,000, which will be brought to the Floor tomorrow,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Sunday night. PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNS COVID RELIEF, SPENDING BILL AVERTING SHUTDOWN. SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW? \"Every Republican vote against this bill is a vote to deny the financial hardship that families face and to deny the American people the relief they need,\" she added.\u00a0 The bill the House will vote on Monday was first introduced by Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass. It's just a few pages long and simply changes the passages in the stimulus\u00a0Trump just signed that say $600 to $2,000. That made\u00a0its enactment dependent on Trump signing the stimulus and spending bill, which was in doubt until Sunday night.\u00a0 Trump signing the stimulus, however, is just one step that needs to happen if Democrats' effort for $2,000 checks is to succeed. It will still need to clear the GOP-controlled Senate and later be signed by the president. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said, \"I would be surprised if we dealt with it\" if Democrats managed to pass a bill for $2,000. In this Nov. 5, 2020, file photo President Trump speaks at the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)  Plus, the fact that Trump signed the stimulus into law may take pressure off Republicans in both the House and the Senate to vote for the boosted checks, allowing them to stick to their guns on keeping the size of the relief package under control. The government is now funded for the next year, crucial benefits helping Americans through the pandemic are renewed and $600 checks will be on the way even if the $2,000 checks don't pass. MCCONNELL PRAISES TRUMP FOR SIGNING COVID-19 RELIEF, GOVERNMENT FUNDING Trump Sunday night as he signed the funding package said he plans to send requests for Congress to address his foreign aid objections separately, potentially indicating he is open to dual efforts on the size of the stimulus checks and cutting foreign aid funding. Notably, however,\u00a0House Appropriations Committee Chair Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., said the House will not\u00a0address Trump's \"recissions\" requests.\u00a0 And the Senate will still have to agree to boost the checks if the bill passes the House.\u00a0 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Sunday he will aim to swiftly pass the $2,000 checks through the Senate if it makes it through the House.\u00a0 \"The House will pass a bill to give Americans $2,000 checks,\" He said in a Sunday tweet. \"Then I will move to pass it in the Senate. No Democrats will object. Will Senate Republicans?\" Adding to the intrigue is the fact Pelosi has set the Monday bill up to be voted on as a \"suspension\" measure, meaning that it\u00a0will require a two-thirds supermajority vote to pass. It's not clear exactly how many Republicans will vote for the checks. That number could also potentially be affected by further Twitter exhortations from Trump on Monday.\u00a0 Fox News is told by a member of House GOP leadership that the measure should secure two-thirds, but that sentiment is not necessarily universal.\u00a0 The House meets Monday afternoon and it's not expected to start taking votes until the early evening\u00a0-- the body will also vote to override the president's veto on the National Defense Authorization Act Monday.\u00a0 Attendance for the vote will be another element that could affect the margins, as it's not clear every lawmaker will make it back to Washington, D.C., for the Monday after Christmas or will submit proxy votes.\u00a0 And, if the stimulus checks measure initially fails in the House, it could be brought up for a subsequent vote, which would only need a simple majority to succeed.\u00a0 But no matter what happens with the political machinations in Washington, D.C., in the waning days of the current Congress and of Trump's time in office, the fact remains the government has been funded and additional coronavirus aid has been passed, averting a government shutdown and a series of other cascading crises.

Thank you, Mr. President, for putting people over politics.\" \"I thank the President for signing this relief into law, along with full-year government funding legislation that will continue the rebuilding and modernization of our Armed Forces that his Administration has championed,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement.\u00a0\"His leadership has prevented a government shutdown at a time when our nation could not have afforded one.\" Added Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.: \"I am relieved the President has signed our bipartisan relief bill. I hope these emergency benefits can be quickly distributed to keep Americans fed & housed and our small businesses operating.\" Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.\u00a0 Tyler Olson is a Capitol Hill Producer for Fox News in Washington, D.C.

        "text": "Games\nRep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, says if members of Congress \u2018legitimately did our job at the budgetary level,\u2019 then \u2018we wouldn\u2019t find ourselves in these fixes at the end of the year.\u2019  Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Texas, told \"Fox & Friends\" on Monday that he agrees with President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., that more money should go to Americans in the next round of coronavirus relief checks.  On Monday, House lawmakers, including Burgess, are returning to Washington, D.C., to vote on\u00a0raising stimulus checks to\u00a0$2,000, something that Trump and Pelosi have pushed for and many Democrats and some Republicans have supported.  Host Will Cain asked Burgess how he will vote on that push.  \"First off, it would be great to\u00a0be able to see the legislative language that Nancy\u00a0Pelosi is proposing,\" Burgess responded, noting that he doesn\u2019t believe \"anyone has seen it beyond\u00a0the broad contours of there needs to be more money to Americans,\" which he said he agrees with.  \"I agree with that. I agree with the president on\u00a0that.\u00a0I think he\u2019s exactly correct,\" Burgess said.\u00a0\"I voted against the bill last\u00a0week because I thought it was too big and too many moving\u00a0parts, too difficult for people\u00a0to comprehend.\"\u00a0 \"The final analysis: It really wasn't the help to the\u00a0American people that the\u00a0president had envisioned so he wisely instructed us about\u00a0that and we\u2019ll see today what\u00a0comes out of the speaker's\u00a0office,\" he continued.  Burgess also noted that President Trump has said \"he does not like to sign big\u00a0omnibus bills,\" adding that he thinks the president \"is correct about\u00a0that.\" President Trump objected to foreign aid in the spending provision of the combination measure \u2013 even though the president requested much of that money in his budget request sent to Congress earlier this year. Many Republicans opposed any stimulus checks. But after wrangling, the sides settled on $600 checks.\u00a0Last week, Trump demanded $2,000 direct payments and refused to sign the legislation into law. House Democrats then prepped a bill to provide for $2,000 payment checks. This bill is expected to be on the floor late Monday. At this stage, Fox News is told the House will subject this to a two-thirds vote for passage.  PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNS COVID RELIEF, SPENDING BILL AVERTING SHUTDOWN. SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW? By handling this bill as a \"suspension\" measure (a process that speeds the bill to the floor but requires a two-thirds vote for passage), approving the plan isn\u2019t guaranteed. However, Fox News is told by a member of the House GOP leadership that the measure should secure two-thirds. Cain asked Burgess if he would support a standalone stimulus check increase or if it has to come with accompanying\u00a0reductions in spending. \"I think you do have to\u00a0demonstrate at least some\u00a0willingness to disclose offsets,\" Burgess, who is a physician, said. \"At the very least, shouldn't we\u00a0know the price tag?\"  \"I mean, isn't Speaker Pelosi\u00a0obligated to run this by the\u00a0wizards at the Congressional Budget Office?\" he continued.\u00a0\"Anything that I try to do in the public health space, that's always the push\u00a0back that I get so it seems like that would be a reasonable approach\u00a0this time.\"  He then noted that the \"reality is we don't have time.\" He also noted that he is no longer in Texas and traveled to the \"nation's\u00a0capital prepared to do my job.\" He pointed out what he called \"another travesty,\" which he said was that \"almost 100\u00a0Democrats last time voted by\u00a0proxy.\"  \"They don't even show up to do\u00a0their job so\u00a0heaven help us that we pass a\u00a0bill that we don't read, but we at least ought to show up\u00a0to cast our vote,\" Burgess continued.  He also noted that if members of Congress \"legitimately\u00a0did our job at the budgetary\u00a0level, at the appropriations\u00a0level, we wouldn't find\u00a0ourselves in these fixes at the\u00a0end of the year, everything crammed into one bill\u00a0and then hold a gun to your\u00a0head you\u2019ve got to either vote\u00a0for it or the American people\u00a0suffer.\" \"That's no way to govern,\" he stressed.

The Secret Service and the Treasury Department are working together to help individuals protect themselves from counterfeit stimulus checks, as the Trump administration plans to mail millions of coronavirus relief checks to Americans later this month. The Secret Service partnered with the Treasury Department, the agencies said Monday, in an effort to help individuals who did not receive their stimulus payments via direct deposit to identify their checks, as well as to identify those fraudulent checks that they say could inevitably be floating through the mail system. MNUCHIN DIRECTS INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED STIMULUS PAYMENTS TO\u00a0IRS WEBSITE\u00a0 \u201cWith the implementation of the CARES Act, comes opportunities for criminal activity, like check fraud,\u201d the agencies said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe Secret Service and the U.S. Department of the Treasury want to inform citizens and consumers nationwide on ways to protect themselves during these times.\u201d The USSS and the Treasury Department on Monday released a set of \u201cquick tips\u201d and \u201cgenuine security features\u201d for those reviewing the legitimacy of checks mailed to them. The checks, according to the agencies, will include a \u201cTreasury Seal\u201d placed to the right of the Statue of Liberty on the check. It will say \u201cBureau of the Fiscal Service,\u201d replacing an old seal, which would have read \u201cFinancial Management Service.\u201d That seal, according to the agencies, will show bleeding ink when moisture is applied, causing the black ink to \u201crun\u201d and turn red. In addition, U.S. Treasury checks are printed on watermark paper, which will read \u201cU.S. TREASURY\u201d and can be seen from both the front and the back of the check when held up to a light. The check will also have a protective ultraviolet (UV) pattern, which is invisible to the naked eye. If put up to a UV light, an individual can expect to see the U.S. Seal of an eagle, or \u201cFISCALSERVICE.\u201d Legitimate checks will also have microprinting on the back of the check with the words \u201cUSAUSAUSA.\u201d Finally, on the lower right side of the Statue of Liberty imprinted on the check will read: \u201cEconomic Impact Payment President Donald J. Trump.\u201d \u201cWe at the Secret Service and the U.S. Department of the Treasury are working with our law enforcement partners to ensure a unity of effort to disrupt and deter criminal activity that could hinder an effective response to the pandemic, to help vulnerable organizations, and to recover money stolen from Americans,\u201d they said in a statement Monday, while urging individuals affected to contact local law enforcement, a Secret Service field office, of the Treasury Department. The announcement comes as millions of Americans are awaiting their stimulus checks, which passed as part of the more than $2.2 trillion CARES Act last month. Tens of millions of Americans have already received their relief payment via direct deposit, though the Treasury Department acknowledged last week that there were several \u201cglitches\u201d in sending payments to some individuals who used popular tax filing services in 2018 and 2019. Meanwhile, the IRS last week launched an online tool, the \u201cGet My Payment\u201d app, to allow taxpayers to give the agency their direct deposit information to help speed up the coronavirus relief payments to Americans. The majority of eligible Americans \u2013\u00a0more than 80 million, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2013\u00a0who filed their taxes in 2018 and/or 2019 and received a refund via direct deposit had received their stimulus relief payments by last Wednesday. CORONAVIRUS CHECKS ARE ON THEIR WAY: HERE'S HOW IT WORKS Those who do not file taxes are also now able to go to the IRS website and use the \u201cNon-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here\u201d section to enter their bank information in\u00a0order to receive their payment faster than they would via regular mail. Some Americans can expect to receive paper checks in the mail, but that method of delivery could take months. As part of the CARES Act, people who file their taxes as individuals are eligible for payments up to $1,200, and couples who file jointly are eligible for up to $2,400 plus an\u00a0additional $500 per child under the age of 17. The amount decreases for individuals who earn an adjusted gross income of\u00a0more than $75,000 and couples who earn more than $150,000 a year, by $5 for every $100 in income above those marks. This means the payment is less the higher their earnings are, with it being reduced to zero for individuals\u00a0who make $99,000 or more and couples who make $198,000 or more. The payments\u00a0do not count as taxable income. Similarly, they do not count for determining eligibility for federal programs like Supplemental Security Income.

        "text": "Games\nRepublican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio on Monday voiced support for $2,000 stimulus checks, diverging from some of his Republican Senate colleagues. The House on Monday passed a measure in the\u00a0$900 billion\u00a0COVID-19 relief package that President Trump signed on Sunday night to give Americans making up to\u00a0$75,000 direct payments of $2,000 \u2013\u00a0rather than an initial proposal of\u00a0$600 \u2013\u00a0but it is unclear whether the Senate will vote to do the same. \"I agree with the [p]resident that millions of working-class families are in dire need of additional relief, which is why I support $2,000 in direct payments to Americans struggling due to the pandemic,\"\u00a0Rubio said in a Monday statement. Rubio went on to blame Democrats for rejecting Republican attempts to \"pass additional relief for workers, families, and small businesses...at every turn.\" BERNIE SANDERS, SENATE DEMS SEE DEFENSE BILL VETO OVERRIDE AS AVENUE TO $2G CHECKS \"Remember, months ago Speaker Pelosi and Democrats rejected the Administration\u2019s previous offer of $1,200 per adult and $1,000 per child. Thankfully, she\u2019s finally stopped holding working families hostage,\" Rubio said. He continued: \"I share many of my colleagues\u2019 concern about the long-term effects of additional spending, but we cannot ignore the fact that millions of working-class families across the nation are still in dire need of relief. Congress should quickly pass legislation to increase direct payments to Americans to $2,000.\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., arrives for a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in Washington, May 5, 2020. (Andrew Harnik/Pool via REUTERS)  It is now up to the Senate to vote on the measure that Trump has been pushing for since last week, though\u00a0Senate\u00a0Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not publicly stated how he plans to address the issue. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rubio will also introduce legislation to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act so that it continues to protect small businesses and companies that promote free speech on the Internet but takes away \"immunity\" for certain Big Tech platforms that moderate certain content, according to a press release. Section 230 offers liability protections to websites\u00a0that allow third-party users to post content on their platforms. \"I also stand ready to work with my colleagues to make much-needed changes to Section 230 and take steps to ensure the American people can once again have confidence in our elections,\"\u00a0Rubio said. WHEN CAN ELIGIBLE AMERICANS EXPECT TO SEE CHECKS? President Trump last week vetoed the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 after warning he would do so if it didn\u2019t repeal\u00a0Section 230. The House on Monday voted to override the veto. Audrey Conklin is a digital reporter for Fox News Digital and FOX Business. Email tips to\u00a0audrey.conklin@fox.com or on Twitter at @audpants.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., slammed the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill passed by Senate Democrats Saturday, listing off a number of convicted murderers who would receive stimulus checks under the bill.\u00a0 House Democrats plan to offer their final approval of the bill Tuesday before sending it to President Biden\u2019s desk. The bill includes $1400 stimulus checks for individuals who make less than $75,000.\u00a0 Inmates are included among those who receive stimulus checks, just as they were in\u00a0both of the previous Covid relief bills that offered $1,200 and $600 checks. Cotton voted for both of those bills.\u00a0 Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., Cotton and\u00a0Ted Cruz, R-Texas, offered an amendment on the floor Saturday to block checks from prisoners. It failed on a party-line vote, 49-50. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., argued that prisoners' children could be affected by withholding the money from them.\u00a0 \"Prisoners have all their living and medical expenses paid for by the taxpayer, they don\u2019t pay taxes, they don't contribute to the\u00a0tax base, they can't be unemployed. Inmates are not economically impacted by Covid,\" Cassidy argued.\u00a0 The IRS had tried to withhold stimulus checks from incarcerated individuals, but a court forced their hand to offer the checks in October. There was nothing written in the previous two relief bills or the one passed Saturday against inmates receiving checks.\u00a0 SENATE PASSES COVID RELIEF BILL AFTER SLEEPLESS, TULMULTUOUS NIGHT There are approximately 1.4 million in prisons across the country.\u00a0 \"Dylann Roof murdered nine people. He's on federal death row,\" Cotton wrote on Twitter. \"He'll be getting a $1,400 stimulus check as part of the Democrats' \u2018COVID relief\u2019 bill. \"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Bomber, murdered three people and terrorized a city,\" Cotton wrote in a separate tweet. \"He'll be getting a $1,400 stimulus check as part of the Democrats' \u2018COVID relief\u2019 bill.\" BERNIE SANDERS AMENDMENT FOR $15 MINIMUM WAGE FAILS IN SENATE IN LONGEST VOTE IN HISTORY \"Aaron Shamo was sentenced to life in prison for selling \"1 million fentanyl-laced fake oxycodone pills to unsuspecting buyers,\" Cotton wrote. \"He'll be getting a $1,400 stimulus check while in prison from the Democrats' \u2018COVID relief\u2019 bill.\" Following 27 hours of debate, delays and wrangling, Democrats pushed through the legislation in a party-line vote of 50-49. The legislation now heads back to the House for final approval before hitting Biden\u2019s desk for his signature on what would be his first major legislative victory. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In addition to the stimulus checks, the bill will extend $300-per-week unemployment benefits through September and offer more food, child care and rental assistance to struggling Americans.

Americans still waiting on coronavirus relief, including stimulus checks, from the federal government may be surprised to learn that President Biden is reportedly offering $4 billion to Central American countries for development. Mexico\u00a0President\u00a0Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u00a0said Saturday that Biden told him the U.S. would send $4 billion to help development in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala \u2014 nations whose hardships have spawned tides of migration through Mexico toward the United States. IF BIDEN HALTS BORDER WALL, IT COULD COST TAXPAYERS BILLIONS, CBP CHIEF WARNS Meanwhile, many Americans have not yet received their $600 stimulus checks that were approved as part of the $900 billion relief package passed in December. While some Americans have received checks, the rollout is still ongoing.

(Kevin Dietsch/Pool via AP)  Biden has been pushing a third relief package that would include $1,400 checks for individuals, but a\u00a0bipartisan group of senators balked at the size of Biden's $1.9 trillion\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0relief proposal during a call with White House officials on Sunday, raising concerns that the measure provides too much money to high-income Americans. BIDEN SPARKS BACKLASH AMONG SOME PROGRESSIVES OVER $1,400 STIMULUS CHECKS Biden wants\u00a0a massive plan that\u00a0includes $20 billion to accelerate vaccine distribution,\u00a0a $15-an-hour minimum wage increase, an extension of supplemental unemployment benefits through the end of September,\u00a0a one-time $1,400 stimulus check, a temporary expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit and $350 billion in new funding for state and local governments.

Former President Donald Trump threatened to cut aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador for \"doing nothing\" about migrant caravans in 2019 after pledging to give them billions in 2018.

        "text": "Games\nAnalysis from Axios national political reporter Jonathan Swan. House Democrats have put forth their biggest and most expensive coronavirus aid package yet, with a price tag of around $3 trillion, Fox News is told. Here is what\u2019s inside the proposal: More direct payments\u00a0 The package, dubbed the HEROES Act, includes more direct payments beyond the $1,200 check most Americans received under earlier legislation. The new bill offers another $1,200 payment for each family member in a household, up to $6,000. State and local government aid The bill allocates about $1 trillion to state, local and tribal governments for \u201chonoring our heroes,\u201d the legislation\u2019s namesake. Democrats have argued that with a loss of tax revenue, states and cities desperately need federal aid to pay health care workers, first responders, police and teachers. Republicans have argued against bailing out \u201cpoorly run\u201d states that have pension deficits and other financial issues that predate coronavirus. HOUSE DEMS UNVEIL CORONAVIRUS BILL ESTIMATED TO COST $3T, IN LARGEST STIMULUS PACKAGE YET\u00a0 Hazard pay for essential workers\u00a0 A \u201cHeroes Fund\u201d would be established, providing $200 billion to essential workers who worked during the pandemic as hazard pay. Payroll tax credit\u00a0 Businesses will receive a tax credit if they keep employees on their payroll, allowing 60 million to keep their paychecks and benefits, according to a fact sheet provided by a Democratic aide. The credit is an expanded version of the one that Congress passed in March -- it would cover 80 percent of $45,000 of costs per employee, up from 50 percent of $10,000. President Trump has repeatedly pushed for a payroll tax cut to be included in the bill, which is not. KEVIN MCCARTHY SLAMS 'PELOSI-LED PIPE DREAM': 'THE FOUNDERS WOULD BE APPALLED' Payroll Protection Program\u00a0 The Paycheck Protection Program would be expanded \u201cto ensure it reaches underserved communities\u201d by providing $10 billion in COVID-19 emergency grants. Extended unemployment benefits\u00a0 Weekly $600 federal unemployment payments, additional to state benefits, would be extended\u00a0until next January. Affordable Care Act enrollment\u00a0 The bill would create a special enrollment period in Affordable Care Act exchanges for the uninsured and would protect those losing their employer-provided health insurance with COBRA subsidies. Food/housing assistance There would also be $175 billion\u00a0given to help families pay their mortgage, rent or utility costs. Maximum SNAP benefits, currently at $768 per month, would be increased by 15 percent. Testing, tracing and treatment funding Another $75 billion would be provided to \u201censure every American can access free coronavirus treatment,\u201d and to expand testing and contact tracing measures.

        "text": "Games\nFormer Deputy Assistant in the Clinton administration Matt Bennett and former Deputy Assistant to President George W. Bush Brad Blakeman weigh in. President-elect Joe Biden on Saturday called on\u00a0President Trump to sign the coronavirus stimulus bill\u00a0--\u00a0warning that failing\u00a0to do so would have\u00a0\"devastating consequences\" for millions of Americans. Biden's push comes as Trump and Congress battle over the size\u00a0of direct payments included in the mammoth legislation. \"It is the day after Christmas, and millions of families don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll be able to make ends meet because of President Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to sign an economic relief bill approved by Congress with an overwhelming and bipartisan majority,\" Biden said in a statement. PELOSI PLEDGES HOUSE VOTE ON $2000 CHECKS AS MONDAY SHUTDOWN DEADLINE LOOMS\u00a0 The president-elect noted that that stalemate comes as about 10 million Americans are about to lose unemployment benefits. An eviction ban will expire on New Year's Eve. \"This abdication of responsibility has devastating consequences,\" he said. Congress passed a $900 billion COVID-relief bill combined with an omnibus spending package to keep the government open in a $2.3 trillion package. Both were passed by large majorities and sent to Trump\u2019s desk to sign. Trump has so far refused to sign it, objecting to what he called \"wasteful and unnecessary\" spending in the bill on areas such as foreign aid, and calling for the $600 stimulus\u00a0payments to be increased to $2,000 per person.\u00a0 \"I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000, or $4,000 for a couple,\" Trump said in a Twitter video. \"I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation, and to send me a suitable bill or else the next administration will have to deliver a package, and maybe that administration will be me.\" Trump's own White House negotiators signed off on the COVID relief package. Meanwhile, Democrats have shown enthusiasm for the higher checks, but not for the spending cuts. A unanimous consent request by Democrats for higher checks, and a Republican request to cut some of the spending, were blocked by their opposite parties Thursday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said Thursday that next week she will force\u00a0lawmakers to take a recorded vote on $2,000 stimulus checks for Americans. As the stalemate continues, the prospect of another government shutdown also becomes more likely. Biden, in his statement, pointed to further consequences if no deal was found. SOME WON'T RECEIVE SECOND STIMULUS CHECK IF CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL IS SIGNED -- HERE'S WHY \"In less than a week, a moratorium on evictions expires, putting millions at risk of being forced from their homes over the holidays. Delay means more small businesses won\u2019t survive this dark winter because they lack access to the lifeline they need, and Americans face further delays in getting the direct payments they deserve as quickly as possible to help deal with the economic devastation caused by COVID-19,\" he said.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden promised he will seek\u00a0more relief for individuals and businesses crippled by the pandemic after he takes office next month. \"This bill is critical. It needs to be signed into law now,\" he said. \"But it is also a first step and down payment on more action that we\u2019ll need to take early in the new year to revive the economy and contain the pandemic \u2014 including meeting the dire need for funding to distribute and administer the vaccine and to increase our testing capacity.\" Fox News' Tyler Olson contributed to this report.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders all favored the president\u2019s proposal for $2,000 direct payments over the $600 that Congress has suggested in its $900 billion plan. Trump made his pitch in a video posted on Twitter, in which he slammed the Covid bill as a \"disgrace,\" and assailed many individual line items in the 5,000-page plan approved by Congress \u2013 calling on lawmakers to amend the package, which would require the president\u2019s signature to become law. \"It\u2019s called the Covid relief bill but it has almost nothing to do with Covid,\" the president noted. FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF, TRUMP DEMANDS CONGRESS INCREASE DIRECT PAYMENTS TO AMERICANS \"It\u2019s called the Covid relief bill but it has almost nothing to do with Covid.\" Trump then listed numerous allocations to foreign countries, $40 million for the Kennedy Center in Washington and additional millions for research projects \u2013 as well as other non-Covid-related objectives.  \"The bill also allows stimulus checks for the family members of illegal aliens, allowing them to get up $1,800 each,\" the president says. \"This is far more than the Americans are given.  \"Despite all of this wasteful spending, and much more, the $900 billion package provides hard-working taxpayers with only $600 each in relief payments and not enough money is given to small businesses -- and in particular restaurants, whose owners have suffered so grievously.\" The president\u2019s critics quickly voiced their rare support for his point of view. President Trump's call for $2,000 stimulus checks to Americans drew support from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders.\u00a0  Pelosi retweeted the president\u2019s video. \"Republicans repeatedly refused to say what amount the President wanted for direct checks,\" the San Francisco Democrat wrote. \"At last, the President has agreed to $2,000 \u2013 Democrats are ready to bring this to the Floor this week by unanimous consent. Let\u2019s do it!\" Ocasio-Cortez added her enthusiastic support. \"Let\u2019s do it,\" the New York Democrat concurred. \"@Rashida Tlaib and Ialready co-wrote the COVID amendment for $2,000 checks, so it\u2019s ready to go. Glad to see the President is willing to support our legislation. We can pass $2k checks this week if the Senate GOP agrees to stand down.\" Sanders also supported the president\u2019s proposal, retweeting Pelosi\u2019s message. \"That\u2019s great!\" the independent U.S. senator from Vermont wrote. \"I first introduced a bill to provide a $2,000 direct payment with @SenKamalaHarris & @EdMarkey 7 months ago. Now, Mr. President, get Mitch McConnell and your Republican friends to stop opposing it and we can provide working class Americans with $2,000.

Josh Hawley of Missouri has been a vocal supporter of more financial assistance for Americans as they deal with the pandemic \u2013 with millions of them having lost their jobs and faced evictions from their homes. \"@realDonaldTrump is right,\" Hawley wrote Tuesday night. \"Workers deserve much more than $600, as I have repeatedly said & fought for.

The federal government is suing convicted murderers and sex traffickers who received COVID-19 stimulus checks, ordering them to use the funds to pay restitution to their victims\u2019 families, according to court documents reviewed by Fox News Digital.\u00a0 Senate Republicans cried foul last week after it was revealed that Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev received a $1,400 stimulus check under the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill known as the American Rescue Plan of 2021, which was signed by President Biden last March. SENATE DEMS CLEARED WAY FOR BOSTON BOMBER, OTHER CONVICTED MURDERERS TO RECEIVE STIMULUS CHECKS Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La. (Reuters) Sens.\u00a0Bill Cassidy, R-La., Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, offered an amendment on the floor at the time to block checks from prisoners, but it failed on a party-line vote, 49-50. The previous coronavirus relief bills also lacked any language barring imprisoned felons from receiving stimulus payments.\u00a0 \"Senate Democrats blocked my amendment to prevent prisoners, like the Boston Marathon bomber, from receiving government stimulus checks,\" Cassidy said in a statement last week to Fox News Digital. \"It is an insult to victims.\" Federal officials in Massachusetts filed a motion Wednesday urging the court to order Tsarnaev\u00a0to hand over the $1,400 COVID\u00a0relief money and any other funds in his inmate trust account to be put toward the more than $101 million he owes his victims. Tsarnaev\u00a0is just one of many federal prisoners who are being sued by the federal government in an effort to ensure the stimulus checks are used to pay their court-ordered restitution, court documents reviewed by Fox News Digital show. \u00a0 This file photo released April 19, 2013, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. (FBI via AP, File) Anthony Robinson, a prisoner at the\u00a0United States Penitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana, is serving a life sentence for murdering two people. He was sued by federal officials in August and ordered to relinquish his stimulus money to be used as payment toward the thousands he still owed in restitution.\u00a0 Yancey Myers, a prisoner at the\u00a0Federal Correctional Institution in Gilmer, West Virginia, is serving 30 years behind bars for supplying a fatal dose of heroin to a 23-year-old North Dakota man. In August, a judge declared that Myers\u2019 stimulus money was not exempt from being seized by the government and ordered him to turn over more than $1,000 to go toward restitution. Yancey Myers.

BOSTON BOMBER HAS NOT PAID ANY OF $101M RESTITUTION, DESPITE SENDING FAMILY $2k FOR 'GIFTS': FEDS James Johnson, an inmate at the\u00a0Federal Correctional Institution Milan in Michigan, is serving 10 years in prison for possessing stolen firearms. He was ordered to turn over more than $1,100 of his stimulus money to go toward restitution in August.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The judges in many of those cases determined that the prisoners\u2019 receipts of COVID-19 relief money\u00a0constituted a \"material change of economic circumstances affecting the ability to pay restitution.\" When reached for comment, the Federal Bureau of Prisons directed Fox News Digital to a FAQ page on the Internal Revenue Service website, which states that the IRS cannot deny a payment to someone who is incarcerated if they are a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien, if they are not claimed as a dependent of another taxpayer, and if they also have a Social Security number valid for employment.

        "text": "Games\nSouth Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds joins 'Fox &amp; Friends First' after meeting with the president to discuss a scaled-down stimulus proposal. President Biden is reportedly open to compromising on the structure of stimulus checks in his proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, but he is adamant that they will go out. Biden told House Democrats on Wednesday that he is open to modifying the adjusted gross income thresholds for an additional round of direct payments \u2013 but he is holding steadfast to the $1,400 check amounts, according to Politico. \"We can better target the number, I\u2019m okay with that,\" Biden said on the call, according to the publication. \"I am not going to start by breaking a promise to the American people.\" In a $600 billion counterproposal, Republicans offered up $1,000 payments targeted to low-income households. But progressive Democrats have already criticized $1,400 payments \u2013 claiming Americans were promised $2,000. However, including the $600 checks approved in December, an additional $1,400 would make eligible households whole at $2,000. Refining eligibility criteria would be a compromise, since conservatives, as well as Sen. Joe Manchin, W.Va., are wary of the package\u2019s overall price tag.  Manchin is a critical vote whether Democrats intend to move the package forward through the reconciliation process, given the evenly split partisan power balance in the chamber, or through bipartisan negotiations. Targeting the payments would mean, however, that some individuals who received the $600 checks would not receive additional money. A spokesperson for the White House did not return Fox News\u2019 request for comment, but White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki indicated during a press briefing on Wednesday that the president was discussing income levels for\u00a0check recipients. MANCHIN\u2019S MISGIVINGS ABOUT $1.9T RELIEF PLAN INCLUDE $15 MINIMUM WAGE, $350B STATE AND LOCAL AID As previously reported by FOX Business, Biden has publicly said he was open to negotiating the terms of the stimulus checks as laid out in his $1.9 trillion package. \"For example, you know I proposed that we \u2014 because it was bipartisan, I thought it would increase the prospects of passage \u2014 the additional $1,400 in direct cash payment to folks,\" Biden said late last month. \"Well, there\u2019s legitimate reason for people to say, \u2018Do you have the lines drawn the exact right way? Should it go to anybody making over X-number of dollars or why?\u2019\u00a0I\u2019m open to negotiate those things.\" Biden added that he picked the terms because he thought them to be \"rational and reasonable,\" while adding it was still a \"bit of a moving target.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Biden met with a group of moderate Republicans at the White House on Monday to discuss the terms of an additional relief package. While Republicans said they were encouraged by the discussions, the White House said after the meeting that Biden was not prepared to compromise on a package that \"fails to meet the moment.\" Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0again blocked quick action on\u00a0$2,000\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0stimulus checks on the Senate floor Thursday as he traded harsh words with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. McConnell, R-Ky., in floor remarks lambasted the House-passed bill for $2,000 stimulus checks as \"socialism for rich people.\" The comments were his most direct\u00a0to date on his opposition to President Trump's request that stimulus checks be boosted from $600 in the recently passed stimulus. \"The data show that many upper-middle class Americans have kept their jobs, work remotely and remain totally financially comfortable,\" McConnell said. \"On the other hand, some of our fellow citizens have had their entire existences is turned upside down and continue to suffer terribly. We do not need to let the speaker of the House do socialism for rich people in order to help those who need help.\" The majority leader earlier this week introduced his own bill for $2,000 stimulus checks, tying them to\u00a0other Trump priorities:\u00a0repealing controversial Section 230 liability protections for online platforms and investigating election security. He made no promises that the bill would be considered, only vague comments that the Senate would \"begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., walks to the Senate floor on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, Dec. 30, 2020. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)  HERE'S WHEN YOUR SECOND STIMULUS CHECK WILL ARRIVE McConnell also Wednesday emphasized that just this week the president signed a $900 billion stimulus package that included \"targeted\" stimulus efforts.\u00a0 \"The liberal New York Times reported this morning that a majority of the households that get non-targeted checks do not end up spending them on urgent needs,\" McConnell said, before detailing the provisions in the recent stimulus bill. \"There are billions for targeted food assistance, billions for targeted rental assistance, and many billions of dollars for vaccine distribution so we can finally beat this virus and re-open the economy in full. These are the kinds of targeted emergency programs that directly help the most vulnerable. And we just poured almost another trillion dollars into them less than five days ago.\" Schumer, D-N.Y., replied that McConnell is just trying to stall to prevent the checks from being passed. He said the majority leader's\u00a0insistence that the Senate only consider checks along with Section 230 and election security would make it impossible for anything to become law. BERNIE SANDERS AGREES WITH TRUMP'S PUSH FOR MORE CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS \"Let me make this offer to the Republican majority. We're willing to vote on the other issues that President Trump mentioned. All the issues the Republican leader says must be addressed, so long as we vote on them separately,\" Schumer said. \"If\u00a0Leader McConnell wants a vote on these issues, we're here for it. Just give us a vote on the House-passed bill and\u00a0we can vote on whatever right-wing conspiracy theory you'd like.\" Schumer then requested that the Senate quickly vote on the House bill on $2,000 stimulus checks. McConnell objected. Soon after Schumer spoke, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., also moved to quickly vote on the House bill for stimulus checks. McConnell\u00a0objected to that, too. Sanders said McConnell's move to tie $2,000 checks to Section 230 repeal and a voter fraud commission is a \"poison pill designed to kill that legislation.\" McConnell's resistance to $2,000 checks comes despite calls for the checks by Trump since shortly after Congress sent him the earlier stimulus bill with $600 checks. Trump has become increasingly frustrated with his fellow Republicans in recent weeks and directed a significant amount of that at top Senate Republicans. \"Unless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH!\" Trump tweeted earlier this week.\u00a0\"Also, get rid of Section 230 - Don\u2019t let Big Tech steal our Country, and don\u2019t let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough!\" He added later: \"$2000ASAP!\" STIMULUS CHECKS ROUND 1 WENT TO DEAD PEOPLE: IS IRS BETTER PREPARED NOW? The uproar over the stimulus checks came on what was scheduled to be a relatively tame Thursday in the upper chamber, as it's prioritized overriding President Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act.\u00a0 The Senate had no scheduled votes for Thursday. McConnell filed a \"cloture petition\" on the NDAA veto override Wednesday, which cannot be voted on until two days after it is filed. The Senate is currently scheduled to take its cloture vote -- meaning a procedural vote to end debate -- on the NDAA Friday, which would set up a final vote Saturday. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\u00a0 Between the Senate needing to pass the NDAA before the current Congress ends at noon on Sunday and McConnell's stalling tactics, it is now highly unlikely that the Senate will even make it to a vote on $2,000 stimulus checks, let alone pass them.\u00a0 Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.\u00a0 Tyler Olson is a Capitol Hill Producer for Fox News in Washington, D.C.

Brian Mast weighs in on President Trump suspending funding to the World Health Organization over the COVID-19 outbreak Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. President Trump's name will appear on millions of economic stimulus checks sent to Americans as part of the $2.2 trillion stimulus package passed by Congress and signed by the president last month in an effort to stem the economic effects of the coronavirus. Sources confirmed to Fox News that Trump's name will appear on paper checks --\u00a0in the memo section -- though his signature is not expected to be included. The Washington Post\u00a0first reported the change Tuesday night.\u00a0Citing unnamed senior IRS officials, the Post reported that the Treasury Department is\u00a0ordering the president's name be printed on the checks in a decision that was made Monday. The Post's sources indicated that the change on the $1,200 checks could delay the time it takes for the checks to reach Americans, but other Treasury Department officials disputed that was the case. One official told Fox News that the checks \"are scheduled to go out on time and exactly as planned\u2014there is absolutely no delay whatsoever.\u00a0In fact, we expect the first checks to be in the mail early next week which is well in advance of when the first checks went out in 2008 and well in advance of initial estimates.\" Americans whose banking information the IRS has will not get the Trump-signed checks, and instead will receive a direct deposit that does not include Trump's name. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW President Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the Rose Garden of the White House, Tuesday, April 14, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)  TRUMP ANNOUNCES US WILL HALT FUNDING TO WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION OVER CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE Asked about how many hard checks -- featuring Trump's name -- would be going out, a Treasury official told Fox News:\u00a0\u201cThe total number of paper checks is subject to a number of variables, including how much info the IRS obtains through the Non-Filers Enter Payment Info web portal and the Get My Payment portal launching today at IRS.gov.\u00a0\u201c The Post reports the hard checks will have \"President Donald J. Trump\" written on the left side of the checks. It is not standard practice for the name of the president to appear on government checks, and the stimulus checks with Trump's name on them will still be signed by an official with the Bureau of Fiscal Service, according to the Post. The decision to have Trump's name on the checks comes as the government's response to the coronavirus pandemic has become highly politicized, with Democrats panning Trump's often long-winded daily coronavirus briefings and Trump returning fire by criticizing Democratic governors and members of Congress for their responses to the crisis. Trump has also blamed\u00a0the World Health Organization for contributing to the seriousness of the pandemic by putting \"political correctness over lifesaving measures\" as it has often repeated China's claims on the communist nation's handling of the virus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Many on the left have criticized Trump for the decision to print his name on the stimulus checks. \"Delaying direct payments to vulnerable families just to print his name on the check is another shameful example of President Trump\u2019s catastrophic failure to treat this crisis with the urgency it demands,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement. \"If the check you\u2019re waiting for is delayed, you can thank this man,\" Harvard law professor Lawrence Tribe said in a tweet Wednesday morning.\u00a0\"He cared more about getting his name on the check than about your need for it. He\u2019s worse than contemptible.\" The $2.2 trillion CARES Act, the name of the\u00a0package that provides for the stimulus checks, is unlikely to be the last piece of legislation passed to combat the coronavirus, as Trump and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have indicated that they hope to pass potentially two more laws with total expenditures between them of possibly more than $2 trillion. It's unclear whether those further measures would include more checks for Americans, or even when they might be passed.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. The Treasury Department announced Monday that they expect most Americans who are eligible for stimulus checks under the CARES Act to receive payment by the end of April. Several categories of people, however, will not be getting payments under the coronavirus relief package. Here is a breakdown of who will be left out of this program. GYM FRANCHISE OWNER: COVID-19 STIMULUS 'NOT WORKABLE' FOR OUR INDUSTRY Anyone claimed by someone else as a dependent Any person listed as a dependent on\u00a0someone else's taxes is not eligible for their own stimulus check. This includes both children and disabled or elderly adults whose own children may be claiming them as dependents. While the CARES Act allows parents to collect $500 for each child, that only applies to children 16 years old or younger. That means that dependents who are 17 or older do not qualify for this even if they are still in school, and if they do not file their own taxes they cannot get their own check. Certain immigrants The CARES Act notes that non-resident aliens are not eligible for checks. Those with green cards as well as\u00a0H-1B or\u00a0H-2A work visas can collect stimulus checks. Others, such as temporary workers or illegal immigrants, are not eligible, regardless of whether or not they pay taxes. Higher-income individuals The stimulus checks are based on amounts of $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for joint filers, but they decrease for those whose adjusted gross income surpasses certain thresholds. For individual filers, that mark is $75,000, for joint filers it is\u00a0$150,000--\u00a0and for those filing as heads of household, it is $112,000. In those cases, the amount decreases by $5 for every $100 in income above those marks. This means the payment is less the higher their earnings are, with it being reduced to zero for individuals\u00a0who make $99,000 or more and couples who make $198,000 or more. For heads of household, the extent to which their payment decreases\u00a0depends on how many children they have. The Treasury Department said that tens of millions of people will get their payments via direct deposit by April 15. Those who did not provide banking information with their 2018 or 2019 tax filings will either receive checks that will be mailed out before the end of April, or they can use an\u00a0IRS online application that will be launching to allow people to provide information for direct deposit. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Eligible people who do not file taxes will be able to enter bank information at this website\u00a0to get their money faster. The Treasury Department said they expect most Americans to get their money within the next two weeks. They said they will mail notices of payment to everyone within 15 days of their payments being sent.

        "text": "Games\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., says he is 'with the president on this,' but acknowledges Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is right that 'there's no way to get a vote' on the increased stimulus checks by Jan. 3.  Senate\u00a0Judiciary Committee Chairman\u00a0Lindsey Graham told \"Fox & Friends\" on Thursday that he supports President Trump\u00a0on increasing coronavirus stimulus checks to Americans to $2,000 from $600\u00a0but acknowledged\u00a0Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is right that \"there's no way to get a vote\" by Jan.\u00a03.  Graham added that \"you could get a vote\" with the new Congress.\u00a0 \"I think if you had a\u00a0standalone vote on the $2,000\u00a0check it might pass,\" he said.  Graham, R-S.C.,\u00a0made the comments one day after McConnell, R-Ky., accused top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer of \"trying to pull a fast one,\" warning in a floor speech that there was \"no realistic path\" to quickly approve larger stimulus checks for Americans contending with the coronavirus pandemic. \u00a0 McConnell accused Pelosi and Schumer of attempting to \"warp\" Trump\u2019s call for $2,000 direct payments to Americans. The majority leader said the Senate would not separate a vote on $2,000 stimulus checks from a bill\u00a0backed by GOP leaders that includes the establishment of a commission to investigate election fraud and a repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, the measure which protects social media platforms from liability over third-party posts. Trump and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have called on Congress to approve $2,000 direct payments, up from the $600 checks\u00a0detailed in a $900 billion coronavirus stimulus package approved last week. Earlier this week, McConnell said the Senate would \"begin a process\" to consider larger stimulus checks after the body blocked a measure from House Democrats that called for an immediate vote. On Thursday, Graham noted that \"70% of Republicans don't want to\u00a0go to $2,000\" because\u00a0\"they think it's a $430 billion\u00a0cost to the Treasury.\"  \"They think it's an inefficient\u00a0way of giving money to people\u00a0who are hurting because a lot of\u00a0people making $75,000 or less\u00a0haven't been out of work,\" he continued. \"But\u00a0I'm with the president on this.\"  Graham went on to note that he is\u00a0in South Carolina where the \"economy is really hurting.\"  There are income thresholds that determine who would receive the next full round of stimulus payments, which includes individuals earning up to $75,000, or $150,000 for married couples. WARNOCK SAYS GEORGIANS 'CAN'T TRUST' LOEFFLER AFTER SHE BACKS CALLS FOR $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS McConnell said Democratic leaders sought to push through a package that would vastly increase the national debt and provide money to families that are not in dire need of aid.\u00a0 \"I'd like a standalone vote in\u00a0the new Congress on the $2,000\u00a0check,\" Graham said. \"We have seven Republicans who\u2019ve already said they would\u00a0vote for it.\u00a0We need five more.\u00a0I think if we had the vote, we\u00a0would get there.\"  He added that he also would like \"to\u00a0vote on repealing Section 230.\"  \"The untold story is that\u00a0Democrats are in the pocket of\u00a0Big Tech,\" he explained.  \"President Trump wants three\u00a0things: a\u00a0commission to investigate\u00a0fraud,\u00a0$2,000 checks and to repeal\u00a0Section 230,\" the South Carolina senator noted. \"I'm urging Senator McConnell to\u00a0give a standalone vote in the\u00a0new Congress after Jan.\u00a03\u00a0on all three measures and I\u00a0would predict that if you had a\u00a0standalone vote on the $2,000\u00a0check, it's better than 50/50, it\u00a0would pass.\"  Democrats have opposed calls for a repeal of Section 230 and the establishment of an election integrity commission. Graham also acknowledged Thursday that those who oppose increasing the stimulus checks because that would in turn add billions of dollars to the federal debt\u00a0are \"not wrong to be\u00a0concerned about the expense.\"  \"They're not wrong to be\u00a0concerned by the fact that this\u00a0is not the most efficient\u00a0way,\" Graham said.\u00a0\"There are a lot of people who make\u00a0$75,000 or less a year that\u00a0work for the government that haven't\u00a0been laid off one day, but I've\u00a0seen with my own eyes the\u00a0destruction of small\u00a0businesses in South Carolina.\" \"I think a family of four, if\u00a0they got $8,000 dollars, it would\u00a0help our economy.\u00a0I think they need the $8,000,\" he added.\u00a0 Graham went on to say he cannot wait until the vaccine is distributed in large numbers\u00a0but added that \"until then our economy is\u00a0hanging by a thread in South\u00a0Carolina.\"  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"So to my fiscal\u00a0conservative friends, I\u00a0understand your argument, but I\u00a0think the facts on the ground\u00a0throughout the country would\u00a0require us to do more than 600,\" Graham said.\u00a0\"600 is not enough.\u00a02,000 is about right in my\u00a0opinion and I'm willing to vote.\"  Fox News\u2019 Thomas Barrabi contributed to this report.

        "text": "Games\nSen. David Perdue joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the enormous significance the Georgia runoff elections will have on the GOP and the U.S. Georgia GOP incumbent Sens.\u00a0Kelley Loeffler and David Perdue, who are fighting to keep their seats in special runoff elections next week, voiced support for $2,000 stimulus checks\u00a0on Tuesday.  Their announcements put them squarely in President Trump's corner as the Senate weighs a newly passed House measure that would raise coronavirus relief payments to most Americans from $600 to $2,000. Asked on\u00a0\"Fox & Friends\" on Tuesday if she would back Trump's repeated calls for greater relief, Loeffler said she was \"proud to do that.\" \"The president has fought for our\u00a0country from day one.\u00a0He continues to fight for every\u00a0single American.\u00a0I\u2019ve stood by the president 100 percent\u00a0of the time,\" she said.\u00a0\"I\u2019m proud to do that and I\u2019ve\u00a0said absolutely\u00a0we need to get\u00a0relief to Americans now and\u00a0I will support that.\" MARCO RUBIO BACKS $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS, CALLS FOR CONGRESS TO 'QUICKLY PASS LEGISLATION' Following her appearance on Fox & Friends, Loeffler tweeted, \"I agree with @realDonaldTrump \u2014 we need to deliver $2,000 direct relief checks to the American people.\" Perdue also announced in an interview on \"America's Newsroom\" that he would support raising the payments to $2,000. \"I'm delighted to support the president in this \u2013 it's really a $1,400 increment over what we've already done,\" Perdue said.\u00a0\"And I think\u00a0with the vaccine coming, I think this is absolutely appropriate, so I fully support what the president is doing right now ... It's the right thing to do for the people in Georgia.\" Trump signed a $900 billion coronavirus relief bill into law on Sunday, despite sharply\u00a0criticizing its $600 direct payments to most Americans as insufficient. He tweeted Tuesday that Americans had \"suffered enough\" and deserved more relief. Loeffler, in a tight race against Democratic candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock,\u00a0first said last week that she would consider voting for the new figure, which Democrats originally pushed in the stimulus package if it diverted funds away from \"wasteful spending.\"\u00a0 On Tuesday, Loeffler pointed out what she thinks is an \"issue\" as it pertains to her opposing party.  \"Democrats have blocked relief\u00a0time and again,\" she told \"Fox & Friends\" on Tuesday.\u00a0\"That\u2019s why we\u2019re in this\u00a0situation as a country.\"  Loeffler went on to say Republicans have \"tried to pass that relief this summer,\" but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., \"held it up because\u00a0they were playing politics with\u00a0the lives of Georgians and all\u00a0Americans around this election.\" The\u00a0House on Monday passed a measure in the\u00a0$900 billion\u00a0COVID-19 relief package that Trump signed on Sunday night to give Americans making up to\u00a0$75,000 direct payments of $2,000 \u2013\u00a0rather than an initial proposal of\u00a0$600 \u2013\u00a0but it is unclear whether the Senate will vote to do the same. GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFF ENTERS FINAL SPRINT 1 WEEK FROM ELECTION, CAMPAIGNS BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS Loeffler and Perdue voted for the original coronavirus bill last week and praised Trump for signing it,\u00a0but their Democratic challengers Warnock and Jon Ossoff called on them to support Trump's call for the larger payments. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is also pressuring Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to bring the measure to the floor, which has enthusiastic Democratic support. Only four Senate Republicans have said thus far they support the $2,000 checks: Loeffler, Perdue, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. HIP-HOP ARTIST WHO HEADLINED OSSOFF, WARNOCK EVENT STIRS CONTROVERSY AFTER SCREENSHOT EMERGES: REPORT It would need 60 votes to pass, meaning Democrats will need at least eight more Republicans on their side. The announcements come as Trump prepares for perhaps his final campaign stop as president next week in Georgia. Perdue and Loeffler are counting on turning out Trump supporters\u00a0to win the runoffs, which will determine Senate control. Perdue called him and Loeffler the \"last line of defense\"\u00a0against a Democratic Senate majority under President-elect Joe Biden.\u00a0 While Trump narrowly lost Georgia, Perdue finished two points ahead of Ossoff in the general election and fell just short of the 50%\u00a0threshold to avoid the runoff. Warnock won the plurality of the vote in the \"jungle\" special election against\u00a0Loeffler and more than a dozen others, but Republican candidates won more votes than their Democratic counterparts in the race. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We have to hold Democrats\u00a0accountable on Jan.\u00a05 because\u00a0that\u2019s what\u2019s on the ballot,\" Loeffler said. \"Who is going to fight for the\u00a0American people?\u00a0That\u2019s what Perdue and I\u00a0have been doing since day one\u00a0and we\u2019re going to continue to\u00a0do that.\"  Fox News\u2019 Audrey Conklin, Paul Steinhauser and Caitlin McFall contributed to this report.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0are on opposite ends of the political spectrum, but they're on the same page about one thing: Stimulus checks need to be included in the next coronavirus relief bill. GRAHAM SAYS HE AGREES WITH OBAMA THAT AOC NEEDS MORE PROMINENT PLACE IN DEMOCRATIC PARTY The payouts, included in a first round of COVID-19 relief earlier this year, have become a sticking point in negotiations on a second bill. \"I will gladly work w/ @AOC and anyone else who wants to help working families. Families and working people in need should be the FIRST consideration in COVID relief, not last,\" tweeted Hawley, who represents Missouri. After months at a stalemate, Congress is inching towards a $908 billion stimulus bill that excludes $1,200 direct payments to every American, a potential hurdle towards a\u00a0deal for more progressive lawmakers, such as Ocasio-Cortez\u00a0of New York.\u00a0 \"If people don't get UI [Unemployment Insurance] assistance, and if they don't get a stimulus check, then relief isn't going to be felt in their lives, not in a substantive way,\" Ocasio-Cortez told NBC News' Garrett Haake on Friday. \"So will I support resources to hospitals and schools and firefighters? Absolutely. But I am extremely concerned that it's not going to solve the immediate problems that people have.\" MARCO RUBIO SLAMS AOC FOR CRITICIZING PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM: 'WORK MORE, TWEET LESS' Hawley is one of the few GOP lawmakers who support stimulus checks -- doled out in March to people earning below a certain amount of money --\u00a0while other Republicans have bashed the strategy as a \"socialist\" or \"radical\" idea from Democrats. President Trump, however, capitalized on the original proposal, maneuvering to have his name\u00a0enscribed on the checks. The window of opportunity to pass legislation for economic relief to\u00a0millions of Americans is swiftly coming to a close, as unemployment benefits stemming from the pandemic are set to expire the day after Christmas, and moratoriums on evictions and student loan forbearance expire\u00a0at the end of the year.\u00a0 \"If\u00a0you're on the brink of an eviction or if you're behind on six months of bills, you need that check ... and state and local funding isn't going to help you,\" Ocasio-Cortez said.\u00a0 CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Despite pushing for a much larger relief bill before the Nov. 3 election, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., says she is willing to settle for a pared-down version to be passed more immediately as the party sets its sights on a bigger relief package after Jan. 20, when President-elect Joe Biden takes office.\u00a0 Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The possibility of a fresh round of stimulus checks for American families has been thrown into uncertainty amid a congressional impasse over another coronavirus relief package, but parents in North Carolina could soon receive a second cash payment. This week, the North Carolina legislature approved the Coronavirus Relief Act 3.0, a $1 billion spending measure that would give parents of children 17 and younger a $335 stimulus check to help offset the costs associated with child care and remote learning during the pandemic. The checks, called \"extra credit grants,\"\u00a0would be sent out by Dec. 15 to parents who filed taxes. Individuals who received a 2019 state tax return refund by direct deposit will receive the $335 check\u00a0via direct deposit also, according to the legislation. Individuals who did not file can apply for the grant \u2014\u00a0a flat amount, regardless of how many children are in the household. IRS TO MAIL STIMULUS CHECKS TO 50,000 AMERICANS AFTER ERROR \"I know $335 isn't gonna pay off a mortgage, but it'll put a dent in the cost of electronic devices or help pay for a tutor,\" state Senate leader Phil Berger, a Republican, said during a press conference on Wednesday. \"I really am not worried about how parents will spend that $335. All I know is they need it. They deserve it.\" The state Senate passed the bill on Wednesday by a 44-5 vote, with five Democrats voting against it. The House voted for it Thursday, 104-10, and sent the legislation to Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat. \u201cAll I know is they need it; they deserve it,\u201d Berger\u00a0said. REPUBLICANS TO RENEW PUSH FOR STIMULUS DEAL WITH 'SKINNY' PROPOSAL The proposal would spend about $440 million of the roughly $903 million in federal CARES Act money the state needs to allocate by the end of the year. Although both Republicans and Democrats seemed to broadly support a second $1,200 stimulus check for adults and $500 for children and other dependents earlier this summer, negotiations over another round of emergency aid collapsed at the beginning of August. One of the biggest points of contention between the parties is the cost of the aid package. Democrats have offered to come down $1 trillion from the roughly $3 trillion HEROES Act, which the House passed in May. But the White House and Republican leaders want to keep the price tag closer to $1 trillion\u00a0amid growing concerns over the nation's ballooning deficit. CALCULATE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'D RECEIVE FROM THE SECOND STIMULUS CHECK HERE Democrats are now saying they will only sit down with Republicans if they agree to a $2.2 trillion price tag. President Trump has urged the two sides to come together and cut a deal, saying in mid-August that he'd directed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to prepare a second cash payment for Americans with the qualifications identical to the first. \"DEMOCRATS ARE HOLDING THIS UP!\" he tweeted. Individuals who earn a gross adjusted income of up to $75,000 would receive a second $1,200 payment under proposals backed by Republicans and Democrats. For higher earners, the checks will be reduced by $5 for every $100 in income and phased out entirely at $99,000 and $198,000.

Here are some answers to your most pressing questions about how Americans will receive their stimulus money. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. With President Trump signing the massive $2.2. trillion coronavirus stimulus bill last week after it sped through Congress, many Americans will soon receive a much-needed handout from the government in the form of cash payments of up to $1,200 per person.  The amount of money each individual will receive from the federal government will vary depending on one\u2019s income, marital status and number of children \u2013 for more on that CLICK HERE \u2013 but Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said over the weekend that he hopes to have the money sent out in the next three weeks\u00a0(although some experts say it could take much longer given the scale of the payments and how long previous stimulus checks took to arrive in the mail.) While it is fairly straightforward for Americans to figure out how much money they will receive from the federal government, how they will get the money is a little less clear. To clear up some confusion, Fox News has answered some of the most pressing questions about how Americans will receive their stimulus money. CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN How do I get my money? Do I need to apply to receive my payment? The stimulus checks, much like a tax refund, will be handled by the Internal Revenue Service and all you have to have done is file your taxes electronically to have the money transferred to your bank account via direct deposit.  If you have filed a paper copy of your taxes or have closed the bank account used to receive previous tax refunds, the government will send a check in the mail. If you have moved since you last filed your taxes, remember to submit a change of address form, which normally takes four to six weeks to process, in order to have the check sent to the correct residence. The best way to make sure your money arrives as quickly as possible is to file your 2019\u00a0tax return as quickly as possible. This is especially true for people who lost a job in the last year as this could put you in a position to qualify to receive more money. Due to the chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the IRS has also extended the deadline to file taxes until July 15. It has also set up a website a special coronavirus landing page to answer questions, although the site currently says \"Stimulus payment checks: No information available yet. No sign-up needed. Instead of calling, please check back for updates.\" How will I know when I\u2019ve received the stimulus money? According to the text of the bill, Americans will receive a note in the mail \u2013 another reason to update you address information \u2013 informing them of where the payment ended up and in what form it was made. The paper notice should arrive no more than a few weeks after the money was disbursed. If you\u2019re having trouble locating the money \u2013 either in your bank account or via a check in the mail \u2013 there will be information regarding how to contact the IRS in the note mailed to you.  What if I don\u2019t have an income or haven\u2019t filed a tax return? While most Americans are required to file a tax return, certain low-wage workers and people with no income will at the time need to fill out a 1040-EZ form. While you\u2019re not legally required to do so, the short form could help you get your stimulus check from the government. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE My recent income makes me ineligible to receive a check, but I lost my job and anticipate being eligible in 2020. Can I get a check? Unfortunately, at the time, the federal government is using Americans\u2019 most recent tax returns. So if you filed your return when you were making $99,000 or more you won\u2019t be receiving a check even if you\u2019ve recently lost your job.  As the checks are basically an advance on a tax credit that is available for the entire year, you may qualify to receive one once you file your 2020 tax return next year as long as you don\u2019t make $99,000 or more. The stimulus bill also provides other ways for individuals to receive some financial help from the federal government, especially if you\u2019re an independent contractor or a small business owner. There are numerous loans for small business owners or sole proprietors, and you can also file for unemployment benefits with your state. I receive social security or disability payments, do I get a check? I\u2019m a veteran, what about me? I live abroad, can I still get a check? The answer to all those questions is yes, although Americans living abroad will still have to meet the income requirements and have a Social Security number. I\u2019m a college student, do I get a check? If your parents claim you as a dependent, then no, but they will receive an extra $500 for each child they have.

        "text": "Games\nThe White House on Thursday said it is \"critical\" that Congress act \"quickly\" on President Biden's proposals for coronavirus economic relief after a report showed that 900,000 Americans filed new unemployment claims last week, saying \"long-term scarring\u00a0will only worsen\" with delay. White House National Economic Council Director Brian Deese called\u00a0Thursday morning's jobs\u00a0report \"a stark reminder that we must act now\" to get \"immediate relief to families and spur our economy.\" On Thursday, Deese said, \"900,000 more Americans filed claims for unemployment because they are out of work in an economy that is moving in the wrong direction. We must act now to get this virus under control, stabilize the economy, and reduce the long-term scarring that will only worsen if bold action isn\u2019t taken.\" Deese said Biden has outlined a set of \"decisive actions\" in the American Rescue Plan to \"extend unemployment insurance, finish the job in providing $2,000 in direct relief to Americans, and ensure that millions of our families who are struggling to make ends meet, put food on the table, and keep a roof over their head in the midst of this crisis are able to get to the other side with dignity.\" BIDEN PROPOSES SPENDING $1.9 TRILLION AS HE UNVEILS 'RESCUE PLAN' FOR AMERICA During his first day in office, Biden took executive action to extend eviction and foreclosure moratoriums to March 31\u00a0and extended the pause on federal student loan payments and interest through Sept. 30. Deese, earlier this week, said the emergency measures \"are important,\" but said they are \"not a substitute,\" and urged Congress to pass legislation. Biden\u00a0last week\u00a0unveiled a massive $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposal which aims to combat the coronavirus\u00a0and begins to pump up a U.S.\u00a0economy severely battered by the worst pandemic to strike the globe in a century. Over $1 trillion of that total price tag is for direct relief to individuals and families. Biden's plan would also extend and expand unemployment insurance benefits \"so American workers can pay their bills\" and would push to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Former President Donald Trump late last year temporarily refused to sign a bipartisan compromise into law, as he called for $2,000 relief payments to Americans. Biden and congressional Democrats also pushed for a increase to $2,000. Biden's new plans gets the total direct relief to Americans to the $2,000 level.

        "text": "Games\nThird Way co-founder Matt Bennett and former State Department senior adviser Matt Mowers react on \u2018America\u2019s Newsroom.\u2019 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer of \"trying to pull a fast one,\" warning in a floor speech Wednesday that there was \"no realistic path\" to quickly approve larger stimulus checks for Americans contending with the coronavirus pandemic. McConnell accused Pelosi and Schumer of attempting to \"warp\" President Trump\u2019s call for $2,000 direct payments to Americans. The majority leader said the Senate would not separate a vote on $2,000 stimulus checks from a bill\u00a0backed by GOP leaders that includes the establishment of a commission to investigate election fraud and a repeal of Section 230, the measure which protects social media platforms from liability over third-party posts. WARNOCK SAYS GEORGIANS 'CAN'T TRUST' LOEFFLER AFTER SHE BACKS CALLS FOR $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS \"As they\u2019ve tried to do countless times in the past four years, Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer are trying to pull a fast one on the president and the American people,\" McConnell said. \"First of all, they\u2019re hoping that everyone just forgets about election integrity and Big Tech. They\u2019re desperate to ignore those two parts of President Trump\u2019s request.\" President Trump and lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle have called on Congress to approve $2,000 direct payments, up from the $600 checks currently detailed in a $900 billion coronavirus stimulus package approved last weekend. Earlier this week, McConnell said the Senate would \"begin a process\" to consider larger stimulus checks after the body blocked a measure from House Democrats that called for an immediate vote. McConnell said Democratic leaders sought to push through a package that would vastly increase the national debt and provide money to families that are not in dire need of aid.\u00a0 \"Look, it's no secret that Republicans have a diversity of views about the wisdom of borrowing hundreds of billions more to send out more non-targeted money, including to many households that have suffered no loss of income during the crisis,\" McConnell said. \"COVID-19 has not affected all households equally.\" Pelosi, Schumer and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, have led calls among Democrats for increased cash payments to Americans. Schumer said he would call for a Senate vote on the House bill seeking larger payments later Wednesday night. \"At the very least, the Senate deserves the opportunity for an up-or-down vote on increasing the individual payments to the American people,\" the New York senator said. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP McConnell\u2019s remarks raised further doubt about the potential approval of larger payments. Democrats have opposed calls for a repeal of Section 230 and establishment of an election integrity commission. The Treasury Department and the IRS began sending out a second wave of direct payments this week. Officials said the payments will be \"topped up as quickly as possible\" if Congress approves the release of larger checks.

Stimulus checks\u00a0to aid millions of Americans during the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic began arriving Wednesday \u2014\u00a0including some for people who are no longer living, multiple reports said. CORONAVIRUS BILL STIMULUS CHECKS WILL LEAVE OUT THESE GROUPSSocial media posts around the country report relatives of the deceased were notified Wednesday of a direct deposit in their loved ones\u2019 accounts, despite some banks\u2019 websites crashing from the heavy traffic, The Sacramento Bee reported. Now those relatives are wondering what to do. \u201cWill they want the $1,200 back?\u201d a widow whose husband died last year asked on Twitter after she received the full $2,400 payment for married couples. Government checks were deposited in bank accounts of millions of U.S. citizens on Wednesday, April 15, 2020 \u2014\u00a0including some dead people's accounts, reports said. (iStock)  On Wednesday afternoon, the Internal Revenue Service website\u00a0didn\u2019t have guidelines for the payments sent in error to the deceased. GYM FRANCHISE OWNER: COVID-19 STIMULUS 'NOT WORKABLE' FOR OUR INDUSTRY Back in 2009, the Obama administration sent about\u00a089,000 checks\u00a0worth $250 each to dead and incarcerated people as part of the stimulus package meant to combat The Great Recession, The Atlantic reported. A 2010 audit\u00a0by the Office of the Inspector General and the Social Security Administration found 71,688 of those checks went to the deceased. But 41,000 checks issued at that time in error\u00a0were returned, The Wall Street Journal reported. GYM FRANCHISE OWNER: COVID-19 STIMULUS 'NOT WORKABLE' FOR OUR INDUSTRY Spending Social Security money issued to someone else is illegal in the U.S. \u2014 but is \u201crarely prosecuted for small amounts,\u201d the report said. \u201cAt least one person has been prosecuted for cashing a stimulus check not issued to them, in one of the few accusations of stimulus fraud to date,\u201d the Journal reported in 2010. To ensure fraud is kept to a minimum, the SSA consults what\u2019s known as the \u201cDeath Master File\u201d\u00a0to prevent identity fraud. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, a 2010 audit found some deaths were reported after the administration certified the stimulus payments, and the SSA \u201crelied on questionable data\u201d or failed to review all available records \u2014 such as the \u201cNumident for death information,\u201d which is used\u00a0to compile the Death Master File. Approximately $12 million in mistaken payments from 2009 was never returned, the Journal reported. The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.

Kelly Loeffler\u2019s record on coronavirus relief efforts on Thursday, accusing his opponent of failing to secure additional aid for Georgians in the form of another round of stimulus payments. \u00a0\"It's been 265 days since Congress passed the first round of stimulus checks,\" Warnock wrote on Twitter. \"Kelly Loeffler has let families struggle without any more relief for 265 days.\" WARNOCK DISMISSES LOEFFLER CLAIM THAT HE SUPPORTS 'CRIPPLING' BUSINESS LOCKDOWNS The candidates in Georgia\u2019s crucial Senate runoff have traded barbs for weeks over their respective plans to jumpstart the state economy and assist local families. Loeffler has called Warnock a \"radical\" candidate who would embrace socialist policies and support \"crippling\" lockdowns if elected to office. Meanwhile, Warnock has accused Loeffler of ignoring the needs of ordinary Georgians during the pandemic in favor of her own business interests. Congressional leaders are attempting to reach terms on a proposed $900 billion aid package after months of stalled negotiations. If approved, the package is expected to include direct payments of $600 to most Americans,\u00a0$300 in weekly jobless payments and additional relief for small businesses.  The CARES Act, passed last March, included $1,200 checks for single adults and larger checks for families.  CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Earlier this week, Warnock told Fox Business that he \"strongly\" supports the inclusion of direct payments to struggling families in the upcoming aid package, as well as an extended moratorium on evictions. Loeffler supported the first round of stimulus payments. The senator has emphasized a need to support small business through additional forgivable loans in any upcoming relief package. Georgia\u2019s runoff vote is slated for Jan. 5. The outcome of both races will determine which party controls the Senate.

        "text": "Games\nHere are the main takeaways of what is in the $2 trillion stimulus package the Senate is working on to ease some of the economic turmoil caused by the coronavirus. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. The Senate on Wednesday passed an unprecedented\u00a0$2 trillion stimulus package to provide health care and economic aid amid the coronavirus outbreak and national shutdown of American daily life. It now has to pass the House before going to the president's desk for his signature. Here's a look at\u00a0some of the highlights included in the sprawling, 500 page-plus measure. Checks and Unemployment The package provides direct financial help to Americans in the form of stimulus checks sent out to many Americans. The proposal would include a one-time payment of $1,200 per adult, $2,400 per couple in the U.S. and $500 a child. The stimulus checks would phase out for individuals making more than $75,000 and would no longer qualify for those\u00a0making more than $99,000. Those thresholds double for couples. Democrats said the package specifically would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months, rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment, plus a $600 per week add-on, with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time. SENATE DEMS PROPOSE ADDITIONAL $200 IN MONTHLY SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS, AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK Small Business Support\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The massive economic relief package would provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. In addition, $562 million is also being put aside to help small businesses by ensuring SBA has the resources to provide Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) to businesses that need financial support.\u00a0These loans will be available during an emergency period that ends\u00a0June 30 and will be forgiven if the employer continues\u00a0to pay workers for the duration of the public health and financial crisis. Funding for Public Health A large chunk of the bill focuses on public health, including\u00a0$100 billion for a new program to provide direct aid to health care institutions on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic and $16 billion being\u00a0allocated\u00a0to replenish the Strategic National Stockpile supplies of pharmaceuticals, personal protective equipment, and other medical supplies, which are distributed to state and local health agencies, hospitals and other healthcare entities facing shortages during emergencies. Another $4.3 billion will go to federal, state, and local public health agencies to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the coronavirus, including for the purchase of personal protective equipment; laboratory testing to detect positive cases; infection control and mitigation at the local level to prevent the spread of the virus; and other public health preparedness and response activities. An additional $1 billion will be put into the Defense Production Act to bolster domestic supply chains, enabling the industry to quickly ramp up production of personal protective equipment, ventilators, and other urgently needed medical supplies, and billions dollars more for federal, state, and local health agencies to purchase such equipment. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Big Company Loans One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries, including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines, given that Democrats wanted them to abide by new carbon emissions restrictions. It includes $10 billion in grants to help the country's airports as the aviation sector grapples with the steepest and potentially sustained decline in air travel in history. For airlines in particular, the bill includes $46 billion in total for the industry, with\u00a0$25 billion going to\u00a0passenger airlines, $4 billion for cargo companies, and $17 billion for companies deemed important to national security. Republicans also won the inclusion of an \"employee retention\" tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50 percent of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2 percent Social Security payroll tax. With memories of the 2008 financial crisis still on the minds of many lawmakers, the bill will also the immediate disclosure of the recipients of any loans and stronger oversight. This includes\u00a0installing an inspector general and congressionally appointed board to monitor and making sure companies can't use the loans for stock buybacks. A\u00a0 final facet of the bill ensures that companies owned by President Trump's family can't receive any loans from the fund.

As Americans await much-needed stimulus checks from the coronavirus bill that President Trump signed last week, federal authorities are warning of\u00a0a new scam targeting\u00a0people already wary about the pandemic.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. The IRS has reversed course to eliminate\u00a0a controversial requirement on Social Security recipients seeking stimulus checks\u00a0as part of the government's coronavirus response\u00a0package. After initially saying that Social Security recipients would have to file a \"simple\" tax return for 2019 -- which they ordinarily would not do -- the IRS now says the payment will be automatic without it. DO YOU QUALIFY FOR A STIMULUS CHECK IN SENATE'S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL? \"Social Security recipients who are not typically required to file a tax return ... will receive their payment directly to their bank account,\u201d\u00a0Treasury Secretary Steve\u00a0Mnuchin announced Wednesday evening, noting that they will not have to take any action. The change follows\u00a0pressure from lawmakers\u00a0who urged the IRS to drop the condition. \"This filing requirement would place a significant burden on retired seniors and individuals who experience disabilities, especially given the current unavailability of tax filing assistance from Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and Tax Counseling for the Elderly programs during the COVID-19 crisis,\" said a letter from more than three-dozen Democratic senators. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., also pushed for the change.

The bill will\u00a0provide one-time payments of up to $1,200 to adults and $500 per child. The Treasury Department now says that Social Security recipients will have their information taken from\u00a0SSA-1099 and RRB-1099 forms, which was outlined in the CARES Act that provided for the stimulus payments.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez railed against a provision in the coronavirus cash assistance program that penalizes young people and offered advice on how to potentially get around that\u00a0during a virtual town hall this week. The one-time payments of up to $1,200 per person and $500 per child will help most Americans, but there are some exceptions that have frustrated the New York Democrat, including many young people between the ages of\u00a017 and\u00a024\u00a0being passed over. \"There are a lot of populations that are left out,\" Ocasio-Cortez said of the $2.2 trillion stimulus package President Trump signed into law on March 27.\u00a0\u00a0\"And one of the most left-out populations are young people, which has been an extreme disappointment.\" AOC CALLS TO DROP MEDICARE AGE TO \u2018ZERO,\u2019 APPROACH CORONAVIRUS RELIEF THROUGH \u2018LENS OF REPARATIONS\u2019 She added: \"We fought for so much more in this bill because essentially there's this huge gap right now. And as we know, young people are some of the most economically vulnerable, especially when you're just starting off in your life.\" In the\u00a0virtual town hall hosted through her campaign Wednesday to help people apply for coronavirus relief benefits, Ocasio-Cortez explained the \"gap.\" Parents can get $500 per child of extra cash assistance, but only for children up to age 16. And the young people, including many college-age students, can't get the $1,200 check individually if their parents have claimed them as dependents on their tax forms -- which means neither the young people nor their parents get extra help, she said. AOC GIVES FIERY FLOOR SPEECH DENOUNCING CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS: 'THERE SHOULD BE SHAME!' But Ocasio-Cortez offered some tips for a potential workaround. If a family hasn't filed 2019 taxes yet, they should consider not claiming their older children as a \"fix.\" \"My personal piece of advice would be that if ... you have not yet filed in 2019, talk to the person who is claiming you as a dependent and figure out if your personal situation would be better if you all filed separately, or if it ends up being still being the best thing to do to file together.\u00a0So make sure you have that conversation,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"If you think that that's a problem ... and you have not yet filed your 2019 return, you can fix it by filing your 2019 return as soon as possible,\" she added. The progressive pol has been an outspoken critic of the stimulus bill for\u00a0not going far enough to help hard-hit Americans, and she's called for greater reforms, such as Medicare-for-All, a rent moratorium, bigger\u00a0direct payments and more. Anil Melwani, a certified public accountant in New York,\u00a0said Ocasio-Cortez identified a \u201cloophole\u201d that may be helpful to a small number of families, but generally, the tax benefit that parents get for claiming their dependent children, especially those in college, would likely outweigh the $1,200 dollars that\u00a0a young person\u00a0could get by filing independently. \u201cShe did find a loophole that could help a very small percentage of the population,\u201d said Melwani, of 212 Tax and Accounting Services in Manhattan. He cautioned that if a teenager files a $0 income tax return independently and receives a $1,200 check, the money will be part of a future 2020 tax return and could potentially need to be paid back. \"It\u2019s not a check or direct deposit that just shows up and then disappears forever,\u201d Melwani said. \u201cIt is going to be part of your tax return and people just need to keep that in the back of their mind.\u201d Young people are not the only ones excluded from the stimulus help. Wealthier Americans making more than $99,000 individually and immigrants without a social security number are also excluded. The lack of help for teenagers and young adults is especially tough since they are disproportionately affected\u00a0by COVID-19-related layoffs. Younger Americans tend to work in retail, food service, bars and restaurants, which have been shut down due to nationwide social distancing restrictions. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The\u00a0Pew Research Center\u00a0found younger workers make up 24 percent of employment in these\u00a0high-risk service businesses most likely to close down during the coronavirus pandemic. \"Among the 19.3 million workers ages 16 to 24 in the economy overall, 9.2 million, or nearly half, are employed in service-sector establishments,\" the Pew Research Center reported.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0\u00a0Sign up here. The Federal Trade Commission has warned that nursing homes in Iowa, as well as other states, have been coercing residents on Medicaid to hand over their coronavirus stimulus checks.  \u201cWe\u2019ve been hearing that some facilities are trying to take the stimulus payments intended for their residents on Medicaid,\"\u00a0FTC Elder Justice Coordinator Lois Greisman said.\u00a0\"Then they\u2019re requiring those people to sign over those funds to the facility.\u201d \u201cWhy? Well, they\u2019re claiming that, because the person is on Medicaid, the facility gets to keep the stimulus payment,\u201d she continued in her consumer information blog post published May 15.

(AP Photo/Eric Gay)  \u201cThis is not just a horror story making the rounds. These are actual reports that our friends in the Iowa Attorney General\u2019s Office have been getting \u2014\u00a0and handling. Other states have seen the same,\u201d she said. According to the CARES Act, the economic impact payments are tax credits, and, therefore under current tax law, don\u2019t count as \u201cresources\u201d for federal benefits programs, like Medicaid,\u00a0Greisman said. \u201cWhen Congress calls these payments 'tax credits'\u00a0in the CARES Act, that means the government can\u2019t seize them. Which means nursing homes and assisted living facilities can\u2019t take that money from their residents just because they\u2019re on Medicaid,\u201d she wrote.  Family members whose love ones may have already been swindled out of their stimulus checks are urged to first report the matter to their state attorney general\u2019s office before filling out an FTC online complaint form.  \u201cIf a loved one lives in a nursing facility and you\u2019re not sure what happened to their payment, talk with them soon,\u201d Greisman wrote. \u201cAnd consider having a chat with the facility\u2019s management to make sure they know which side of the law to be on.\u201d This comes as nursing homes and extended care facilities across the country\u00a0have suffered outbreaks and\u00a0have barred in-person visitations from family members to prevent further contagion. Their elderly residents remain the most at risk of severe complications or death from COVID-19.

After President Trump signed the federal stimulus package, authorities warned Americans awaiting their checks not to fall for robocalls and text message scams.

Callers, meanwhile, posed as government officials and asked for Social Security information with the false promise of sending benefit funds.

McConnell, R-Ky., in floor remarks lambasted the House-passed bill for $2,000 stimulus checks as \u2018socialism for rich people.\u2019 The comments were his most direct to date on his opposition to President Trump's request that stimulus checks be boosted from $600 in the recently passed stimulus. \u2026 The uproar over the stimulus checks came on what was scheduled to be a relatively tame Thursday in the upper chamber, as it's prioritized overriding President Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act. The Senate had no scheduled votes for Thursday. McConnell filed a \u2018cloture petition\u2019 on the NDAA veto override Wednesday, which cannot be voted on until two days after it is filed. The Senate is currently scheduled to take its cloture vote -- meaning a procedural vote to end debate -- on the NDAA Friday, which would set up a final vote Saturday.\"Pelosi all but certain to be reelected speaker - AP: \"There\u2019s little doubt that Nancy Pelosi will be reelected House speaker when the new Congress convenes Sunday. It could take a high-wire act for her to get there, largely thanks to the pandemic. The only woman in history to serve as speaker, the California Democrat has a reputation as a formidable vote-counter and wily deal-cutter. Those skills have helped her fend off threats and cement her as leader of her party in the House since 2003, and seem likely to carry the day on Jan. 3, when the Constitution requires the new Congress to begin. \u2026 The full House elects the speaker, and Democrats will have the chamber\u2019s smallest majority in 20 years in a vote in which Republicans are certain to vote unanimously against her, joined by Democratic defectors. Democrats will have a 222-211 edge, with one race still undecided and one vacancy after Rep.-elect Luke Letlow, R-La., died Tuesday after battling COVID-19.\"Pergram: 117th Congress may offer some surprises due to the pandemic - Fox News: \"Some college bowl games are canceled. The NFL is struggling to finish its regular season without canceling a game. People celebrated holiday parties on Zoom. Yet the 117th Congress begins Sunday at noon, Eastern Time. The Constitution dictates that. And everyone has to be there in person. \u2026 Opening day is usually a wildly festive affair with receptions in the House Office Buildings and thousands of family and friends descending on the Capitol. The House is keeping this year\u2019s event as low-key as possible. Freshmen members are issued only one ticket for a guest to watch the ceremonies from the gallery. The House won\u2019t issue any guest tickets to returning members. \u2026 Starting the new Congress is inherently messy in a pandemic.\"[Ed. note: Our endearingly human desire to apply linear timeframes to a non-linear existence is silly, right?

        "text": "Games\nPresident Trump demands increase in payments to Americans; reaction from Fox News contributor Brian Brenberg House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0on Wednesday called on\u00a0GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy to join her in backing a\u00a0boost\u00a0to the coronavirus stimulus checks \u2013\u00a0which would bump them to $2,000 \u2013\u00a0because of a last-minute demand from President Trump. Trump\u00a0in a video posted to Twitter on Tuesday night demanded that\u00a0lawmakers\u00a0amend the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0stimulus package they passed Monday to include $2,000 checks for individuals\u00a0instead of $600 checks, while also insisting\u00a0that \"wasteful and unnecessary\" items be cut from the year-end spending package that was attached to the pandemic aid. TRUMP PUTS GOP ON ITS HEELS WITH 11TH-HOUR STIMULUS DEMANDS, THROWS WRENCH INTO GEORGIA SENATE RACE Pelosi and Democrats\u00a0had wanted much higher stimulus checks, too, but settled on the $600 figure in bipartisan negotiations with their Republican counterparts. So Trump's sudden interest in dramatically increasing\u00a0the checks was an offer that Pelosi was quick to accept. \"Let's do it!\" she tweeted. Pelosi wants to bring a stand-alone piece of legislation to the House floor Thursday morning to increase the stimulus check amount in time for Christmas, daring Republicans to object. \"To do so requires the agreement of the Republican Leader,\" Pelosi wrote in a letter to Democratic colleagues Wednesday. \"This agreement is necessary in the House and in the Senate.\u00a0If the President truly wants to join us in $2,000 payments, he should call upon Leader McCarthy to agree to our Unanimous Consent request.\" In addition to McCarthy's blessing,\u00a0the effort would also need broader support. Unlike a traditional roll call vote, one member of Congress could object on the House floor to scuttle the attempt to pass the measure\u00a0unanimously.\u00a0\u00a0 TRUMP'S CALL FOR $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS HAILED -- BY CRITICS PELOSI, AOC, SANDERS If this last-ditch effort passes the House, it would still need approval from the Senate.\u00a0 Pelosi criticized\u00a0Trump's eleventh-hour antics\u00a0when he was absent from the bipartisan negotiations with herself and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.\u00a0 \"Just when you think you have seen it all, last night, the President said that he would possibly veto the bicameral agreement negotiated between Republicans and Democrats,\" Pelosi wrote to House Democrats. \"...In the bipartisan negotiations, Leader Schumer and I repeatedly asked Republicans what would be the highest number the President would accept for direct payments, and they responded with Sphinx-like silence.\u00a0In the negotiations, they would never go above $600 and in some cases, proposed $500.\" The $600 payments cost about $167 billion. Increasing checks to $2,000 would grow the cost of the bill by $370 billion,\u00a0Ernie Tedeschi, an economist and former Treasury Department official in the Obama administration told The Washington Post.\u00a0 FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF, TRUMP DEMANDS CONGRESS INCREASE DIRECT PAYMENTS TO AMERICANS Schumer, too, put pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to accept the higher checks that Trump says he needs to sign off on\u00a0$900 billion coronavirus relief. \"I\u2019m in. Whaddya say, Mitch?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted.\u00a0 McConnell's office did not respond to a request for comment on what the Senate may do in light of Trump's Monday video. He and other GOP lawmakers had touted the stimulus deal as a triumph on Monday and Tuesday before Trump called it a \"disgrace.\"\u00a0 McCarthy's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\u00a0 Fox News' Tyler Olson contributed to this report.\u00a0 Marisa Schultz is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital.

        "text": "Games\nCharles Payne explains why another stimulus package will allow for a much faster economic snapback Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Thursday that the Trump administration supports issuing another round of stimulus checks to Americans as part of a\u00a0fourth coronavirus relief package, and vowed to enact\u00a0legislation by the end of the month. Mnuchin said in an interview with CNBC that he would not provide \u201cspecific details,\u201d but added that the administration is engaged in conversations with congressional leaders. \u201cWe do support another round of economic impact payments,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cWe\u2019re discussing the criteria with the Senate, and had a productive talk with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\u201d Mnuchin added that the administration will work \u201con a bipartisan basis with Republicans and Democrats,\u201d and said it is a \u201cpriority\u201d to have legislation passed by July 20. President Trump told Fox Business Network earlier this month that he supported another round of stimulus checks, which he signaled could be for even larger amounts than the up to $1,200 per person many Americans received earlier this year. However, not all Republicans\u2014specifically those who are more fiscally conservative\u2014are on the same page. TRUMP SUPPORTS STIMULUS PAYMENTS LARGER THAN $1,200 Meanwhile, Mnuchin also noted that the administration wants \u201cto incentivize people to go back to work,\u201d while addressing the issue of unemployment benefits. \u201cThey are intended for people who do not have jobs,\u201d Mnuchin said. \u201cWe will not be doing it in the same way. We\u2019re in a different situation. Businesses reopened and want to hire.\u201d Republican lawmakers have ramped up warnings that the recent boost in jobless benefits amid the pandemic\u00a0will \u201cpush unemployment higher,\u201d as many individuals are able to collect more money through the unemployment programs than they made while on the job. Under the \u201cPhase 3\u201d economic stimulus package passed in March, also known as the CARES Act, Congress provided $250 billion to extend unemployment insurance to more workers, and lengthen the duration of benefits to 39 weeks\u00a0from the normal 26 weeks. The provision provided for\u00a0an extra $600\u00a0for four months to those who lost\u00a0their jobs amid the crisis. MNUCHIN SAYS EMPLOYEES WHO REJECT OFFER TO RETURN TO WORK ARE INELIGABLE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS The CARES Act also introduced a\u00a0\u201cPandemic Unemployment Assistance\u201d program, which extended\u00a0unemployment benefits to self-employed, independent contractors, those with limited work history, and other individuals not traditionally eligible for unemployment benefits who were\u00a0unable to work as a direct result of COVID-19. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The generous payments are temporary, however, and are slated to end on July 31. Mnuchin warned earlier this year that that individuals who reject an offer from their company to return to work after being laid off due to coronavirus are no longer considered eligible to receive federal unemployment benefits.

As many Americans still wait for their stimulus check, a number of deceased people have\u00a0received payments. Rep. Thomas Massie, R.-Ky.,\u00a0shared a story of a friend receiving a stimulus check meant for his deceased father, and he said he thought coronavirus checks being sent to dead people was just the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d of waste in the massive $2.2 trillion stimulus package. While the extra cash may seem like a lucky bonus, families of the deceased are left wondering: do I need to pay it back? CORONAVIRUS CHECKS REPORTEDLY BEING SENT TO DEAD PEOPLE\u00a0 What does the IRS say you should do? The IRS has added guidelines to its website for payments made to the deceased saying they should be returned by submitting a personal check to the state\u2019s IRS location payable to \u201cU.S. Treasury,\u201d complete with the taxpayer ID number of the deceased and the reason for returning the check. President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have also said those payments should be returned. \"You're not supposed to keep that payment,\" Mnuchin said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. \"We're checking the databases, but there could be a scenario where we missed something, and yes, the heirs should be returning that money.\" REP. MASSIE SAYS CHECKS TO DEAD PEOPLE 'TIP OF THE ICEBERG' OF GOVERNMENT WASTE IN CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS\u00a0 What happens if I don't? It's\u00a0not clear whether recipients are under any legal obligation to return the money. The CARES Act, which authorized the payments, did not include any language forbidding payments to the deceased or how to get back money given to the dead. Back in 2009, the Obama administration sent about 89,000 checks worth $250 each to dead and incarcerated people as part of the stimulus package meant to combat The Great Recession, according to The Atlantic, so Congress could have included such a stipulation against payments to the deceased this time around. AARP recommends holding on to the money until the IRS resolves the issue. Nina Olson, executive director of the Center for Taxpayer Rights, told AARP that there is a provision in tax law for repayment of an erroneous tax refund, but \u201cI don't know of any attorney general in the world who would bring an erroneous refund suit for $1,200.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Under the CARES Act, Americans receive stimulus checks based on their tax returns for 2018 and 2019. If a person died after filing a return in those years, they could still receive the check -- though the government says it must be returned.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday\u00a0introduced his own version of a bill to increase the $600 stimulus checks from the coronavirus relief package to $2,000, but also included two other major priorities for President Trump. The legislation would also repeal Section 230, the controversial liability protection for online platforms, and create a committee on the Election\u00a0Assistance Commission to study election integrity.\u00a0 McConnell set the table for a bill to address these three issues in his floor remarks Tuesday.\u00a0 \"During this process, the president highlighted three additional issues of national significance he would like to see Congress tackle together,\" McConnell said, before listing off the president's grievances about the amount of the stimulus payment, Section 230 and the election.\u00a0 McConnell Bill on Boosted S... by Fox News DEMOCRATS SEIZE ON MCCONNELL'S STIMULUS BLOCK IN GEORGIA RUNOFF \"Those are the three important subjects the president has linked together,\" McConnell said. \"This week, the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus.\" The remarks were not a firm promise that any of these issues would receive a vote or that McConnell would push particularly hard for them. And McConnell's bill itself is unlikely to gain the support of the 60 senators that would be needed to break a filibuster. Some Republicans, especially the handful who have already said they favor $2,000 stimulus checks, would likely back the bill, but most Democrats probably will not vote for it due to the other issues McConnell's bill addresses.\u00a0 What McConnell's bill could do, however, is allow GOP senators who want to be able to say they voted for $2,000 stimulus checks to do so while protecting priorities of the majority of his caucus which has previously opposed the checks.\u00a0 Sen. David Perdue. R-Ga., one of the Republicans who has said he supports $2,000 checks -- and is also in a fierce runoff set for Jan. 5 to hold onto his seat -- said on \"Fox & Friends\" Wednesday that he supports the McConnell bill.\u00a0 \"The Democrats themselves held this up for months and so here in the last minute, they're complaining about the normal operation of the Senate,\" Perdue said. \"I'm an outsider of this process but I can tell you these\u00a0things that Mitch McConnell is trying to do are in line with what the President has said. I support what the President is trying to do relative to Section 230, the repeal of that and also the $2,000 stimulus checks. We're in full support of that.\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called McConnell's proposal a \"cynical gambit.\" No action on McConnell's bill has been scheduled. Trump, meanwhile, warned Republicans that they should support quick delivery of stimulus checks unless they \"have a death wish\" in a Tuesday tweet. He doubled down Wednesday morning, saying, \"$2000 ASAP!\" McConnell on Tuesday blocked attempts by Schumer and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to quickly pass the House bill on stimulus checks which cleared the lower chamber with more than two-thirds of members voting in favor of it Monday.\u00a0 Whether either the House bill or the McConnell bill even receive votes will be up to McConnell, who controls the action on the floor. The majority leader is currently prioritizing efforts to override Trump's veto of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which funds the military for the next year.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump objected to the fact that the bill renamed bases named after Confederates and did not repeal Section 230, but the legislation passed overwhelmingly in both the House and the Senate. The House has already voted to override the president's veto.\u00a0 Sanders has delayed McConnell's efforts on the defense bill in an attempt to extract concessions on the stimulus checks. But if McConnell forges ahead as scheduled, there could be a vote to end debate on the veto override on Friday and a final vote to override the veto on Saturday.\u00a0 The current Congress ends on Sunday, Jan. 3, which means that any other action on stimulus checks must happen quickly. At that point, lawmakers will have to completely restart the legislative process.\u00a0 Fox News' Jason Donner contributed to this report.\u00a0 Tyler Olson is a Capitol Hill Producer for Fox News in Washington, D.C.

Gavin Newsom announced on Wednesday plans to give cash payments to adult immigrants living illegally in the state to help them weather the coronavirus crisis. The plan, which would use a mix of taxpayer money and charitable\u00a0donations from corporations and philanthropists, will give 150,000 adults $500 each during the coronavirus outbreak, the governor said. California has had an estimated 2 million immigrants living in the country illegally. They have not been eligible for the $2.2 trillion stimulus package approved by Congress last month, which pledged cash payments to most Americans while boosting unemployment benefits by $600 per week. \u201cWe feel a deep sense of gratitude for people that are in fear of deportations that are still addressing essential needs of tens of millions of Californians,\u201d said Newsom, a Democrat, who noted 10 percent\u00a0of the state's workforce consisted of immigrants living in the country illegally who paid over $2.5 billion in state and local taxes last year. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW Taxpayers would be kicking in $75 million for the money, while a group of charities has committed to raise another $50 million for a total of $125 million. A group of charities already has\u00a0donated $5.5 million for the fund, including the Emerson Collective, Blue Shield of California Foundation, the California Endowment, the James Irvine Foundation, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and an anonymous donor. Newsom said the money will not be distributed based on income. \u201cTheir personal information will not be required to get those support,\u201d he added. California has been seen as the most aggressive state in the nation when it came to giving benefits to immigrants living in the country illegally. Last year, California became the first state to give taxpayer-funded health benefits to low-income adults 25 and younger living in the country illegally. This year, Newsom had proposed expanding those benefits to seniors 65 and older. The move by California came as some Democrats in Washington, D.C., have been lobbying to include payments to illegal immigrants in stimulus packages. The $2 trillion stimulus package recently passed by\u00a0Congress, which President Trump signed into law, is giving small-business loans and assistance\u00a0in the form of direct payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child. The latter has been distributed to people with Social Security numbers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While that included working legal immigrants -- like those\u00a0in the U.S. on nonimmigrant (temporary) work visas -- with Social Security numbers in order to be able to work legally in the U.S., it did not include people in the country\u00a0illegally. Meanwhile, Washington\u2019s tourism arm announced that it will include $5 million specifically for illegal immigrants who had been left out of employment benefits and other forms of assistance,\u00a0The Washington Post reported.

Meadows encouraged the media to take their cameras to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) on Thursday \u201cbecause you\u2019re going to see members of\u00a0Congress leaving Washington, D.C. to\u00a0go home and pretend like they\u2019re working hard on this\u00a0particular deal when, in fact,\u00a0the checks are not going out to\u00a0the American people and\u00a0unemployment benefits will start\u00a0to cease.\u201d  The possibility of a fresh round of stimulus checks for American families has been thrown into uncertainty amid an impasse between Congress and the White House over another coronavirus relief package. Enhanced unemployment benefits of an additional $600 a week, which was enacted by the CARES Act in March, expired on July 31. Since then, dozens of states have been approved to offer sweetened\u00a0federal unemployment aid, when President Trump signed an executive order last month allocating $44 billion in funding from the Disaster Relief Fund\u00a0to cover the additional $300 weekly benefit. As the novel coronavirus forced businesses to shut down in an attempt to slow the spread, which left tens of millions out of work, the U.S. economy contracted by a 33% annual rate\u00a0in the second quarter, the worst quarterly plunge ever.  The U.S. economy added 1.4 million jobs in August as the unemployment rate\u00a0unexpectedly tumbled,\u00a0indicating the nation's labor market is continuing a slow but steady\u00a0recovery from the pandemic. The Labor Department's payroll report released earlier this month showed the jobless rate fell sharply\u00a0to 8.4%, down from 10.2%\u00a0in June and a peak of 14.7% in April. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the economy needs more support.  The Fed has already taken a range of extraordinary actions to\u00a0support the economy, including slashing interest rates to near-zero in March, purchasing an unlimited amount of Treasurys (a practice known as quantitative easing) and launching nine lending facilities to\u00a0ensure that credit flows to businesses and Wall Street banks. FED'S POWELL SAYS US ECONOMY MAY NEED MORE POLICY HELP TO AVOID 'PROLONGED' RECESSION While the economic outlook has brightened recently, Powell indicated on Wednesday that Congress should pass another emergency relief package to continue aiding the nascent recovery, identifying unemployment aid, small business relief and funding for state and local governments as three key areas. \"More fiscal support is likely to be needed,\" Powell said. \"The details of that are for Congress, not the Fed.\" Powell added that \u201cif there isn't additional\u00a0support, and there isn't a job\u00a0for some of those people who are\u00a0from industries where it's going\u00a0to be very hard to find new\u00a0work, then \u2026 that will\u00a0start to show up in economic\u00a0activity.\u201d  \u201cIt\u2019ll also show up in things\u00a0like evictions and foreclosures\u00a0and things that will\u00a0scar and damage the economy,\u201d he continued.  When asked where things stand on the current negotiations Meadows said on Thursday, \u201cWe\u2019ve had some\u00a0positive movement in the right\u00a0direction.\u201d  He explained that he was \u201con the phone with some\u00a0Democrat House members \u2026 as\u00a0well as a few senators last\u00a0night\u201d and that he\u00a0can see that there are \u201cRepublican\u00a0senators and House members that\u00a0are trying to come together.\u201d  Meadows encouraged everyone \u201cto call on their\u00a0House member to make sure that\u00a0they stay here [and] that we negotiate.\u201d  \u201cAt least let's use\u00a0this $1.5 trillion new\u00a0recommendation as a foundation\u00a0for new negotiations,\u201d he continued.  Meadows was referencing the compromise coronavirus\u00a0package unveiled by a bipartisan group of House lawmakers on Tuesday, which worked out some of the thorniest divisions between Democrats and Republicans in an effort to jump-start relief to\u00a0Americans still reeling from the health and economic crisis. The Problem Solvers Caucus\u00a0released its\u00a0$1.5 trillion coronavirus plan as proof bipartisanship is still afoot and to deliver a pre-packaged\u00a0solution to Republican and Democratic leadership that would meet the nation's most pressing needs for the next six\u00a0to 12 months. Among the highlights of the $1.5 trillion plan include $120 billion for\u00a0enhanced unemployment aid\u00a0through January 2021 at a rate of $450 weekly for an eight-week transition period until states can reconfigure to the new system that would provide up to $600 weekly, but not to exceed 100%\u00a0of the previous wage. The plan also includes $280 billion for another round of\u00a0direct stimulus checks\u00a0worth $1,200 for adults and $500 for children and $290 billion for\u00a0small business and nonprofit assistance, which would include $240 billion for another round of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds. Meadows noted on Thursday that President Trump \u201cwas certainly willing to\u00a0embrace the 1.5 trillion-dollar\u00a0number that was put out in the\u00a0last day or so.\u201d  Meadows also stressed the need for more immediate aid for the airline industry as thousands of airline workers are bracing for layoffs at the end of the month unless Congress overcomes the stalemate. Meadows said he was meeting with airline CEOs on Thursday.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cWe have got tens of thousands of\u00a0people that are about to be laid\u00a0off so if nothing more, let's go ahead\u00a0and put that package on the\u00a0floor and pass that because,\u00a0hopefully, all of us can agree\u00a0that laying off airline workers\u00a0at this particular time is not\u00a0something we should do,\u201d Meadows said.

Get the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., says he is concerned that reports of coronavirus stimulus checks being sent to dead people are just the \"tip of the iceberg\" of waste coming from the massive $2.2 trillion package that Congress passed and President Trump signed last month. Massie was the lone voice\u00a0standing against the bill's expedited passage in the House of Representatives, criticizing the way the House passed it without a recorded vote\u00a0and panning measures he said had \"no direct relation\" to the pandemic.\u00a0He said\u00a0the bill \"shouldn't be stuffed full of Nancy Pelosi's pork.\" Massie attempted to throw multiple procedural roadblocks up in front of the bill but his efforts were steamrolled by an overwhelming majority of the House in one minute and three seconds. Now, the dead relative of one of Massie's friends has been among the many deceased, according to reports, to get one of the\u00a0$1,200 stimulus checks provided for by the enormous bill he stood in the way of. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS CHECKS REPORTEDLY BEING SENT TO DEAD PEOPLE \"I\u2019m worried that this check to my deceased constituent is just the tip of the iceberg,\" Massie said in a statement to Fox News.\u00a0\"The government is in such a rush to get the small business loans and the $1200 checks out the door that many mistakes will be made, and fraud will be rampant. The government is skipping the customary and necessary diligence that\u2019s usually performed when transferring taxpayer money. Will these programs be sufficiently audited a year or two from now? I doubt it.\" On Wednesday afternoon, the Internal Revenue Service website\u00a0didn\u2019t have guidelines\u00a0for the payments sent in error to the deceased. MarketWatch reported the checks sent in error to dead people were not limited to Massie's friend's dad, and that at least one accountant who spoke to the publication had clients who had seen checks sent to dead people. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Back in 2009, the Obama administration sent about\u00a089,000 checks\u00a0worth $250 each to dead and incarcerated people as part of the stimulus package meant to combat The Great Recession, The Atlantic reported. A 2010 audit\u00a0by the Office of the Inspector General and the Social Security Administration found 71,688 of those checks went to the deceased. But 41,000 checks issued at that time in error\u00a0were returned, The Wall Street Journal reported.

        "text": "Games\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell provides updates on the coronavirus funding bill. Saying lawmakers \"need to take bold and swift action as soon as possible,\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday introduced legislation to provide as much as $1,200 per person and\u00a0$2,400 per couple in the U.S. amid the coronavirus outbreak and skyrocketing jobless claims. The draft legislation, obtained by Fox News, would provide minimum payments of $600 for those with no federal tax liability, and aid would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. The rebate amount is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer\u2019s income exceeds the legislation's threshold. The amount is therefore reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. The IRS would\u00a0determine income based on taxpayers'\u00a02018 tax returns, or 2019 tax returns in cases where there is no 2018\u00a0return -- a provision that The Federalist's Sean Davis called \"idiotic,\" given that many \"jobs or businesses disappeared within the last month.\" Qualifying income includes earned income, as well as\u00a0Social Security retirement benefits and certain\u00a0compensation and pension benefits paid to veterans. This approach \"ensures relief gets to low-income seniors and disabled veterans\" as well,\u00a0top Republicans said in their summary of the legislation. READ MCCONNELL'S STIMULUS PROPOSAL And, similar to previous disaster-related relief provisions, the bill would \"waive\u00a0the 10-percent early withdrawal penalty for distributions up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts for coronavirus-related purposes.\" McConnell's proposal aligns with the Trump administration's push to swiftly send checks to U.S. citizens. The legislation additionally\u00a0contains numerous provisions\u00a0geared at helping small businesses, including a delay of payment for employer payroll taxes, a delay of estimated tax payments for corporations,\u00a0and modifications for net operating losses.

Phillip)  McConnell's plan would provide $208 billion in loans and loan guarantees to distressed sectors of the economy, including $50 billion for commercial airlines and $8 billion for air cargo carriers, and $150 billion for other eligible businesses, but those loans would have to be paid back. It's an opening salvo in fast-track talks with Democrats as President Trump urges Congress to \u201cgo big\u201d to respond as Americans reel from the crisis. McConnell, R-Ky., speaking on the Senate floor, said he wanted key Republicans to meet with Democrats on the relief bill, known as\u00a0S.3548, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (Phase III). READ REPUBLICANS' SECTION-BY-SECTION SUMMARY OF THE BILL \"These are urgent discussions and they need to happen at the member level,\" McConnell said, noting the White House will send key personnel to talk about the bill as they try to forge a compromise. Fox News is told McConnell did not yet have the votes on his side, and that the situation was complicated by the fact that two Republicans have self-quarantined. Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley has\u00a0said McConnell's plan doesn't cover enough low-income individuals, and he\u00a0introduced an amendment to that effect on Friday. The GOP holds a slim 53-47 majority in the Senate, with Vice President Mike Pence the possible tiebreaking vote. Speaking after McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., complained that Republicans had sought \"no input\" from Democrats, and asserted that no Democrats had even seen the bill. He added\u00a0he was told \"there is a bailout for industries\" in the measure. \"The number one priority is addressing this health crisis, which requires a Marshall Plan to rebuild our health care infrastructure on a continental scale and ensure the resources are there to test and treat everyone who needs it,\" Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a joint statement. \u201cTo earn Democratic support in the Congress, any economic stimulus proposal must include new, strong and strict provisions that prioritize and protect workers, such as banning the recipient companies from buying back stock, rewarding executives, and laying off workers,\"\u00a0they added. \u201cWe look forward to working in a bipartisan way to deliver for the American people as soon as humanly possible.\u201d ILHAN OMAR PRAISES TRUMP'S 'INCREDIBLE' CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE Even some of McConnell's GOP senators have said they preferred\u00a0instead to use the federal dollars to keep workers who are asked to stay home on the business payrolls. \u201cWhat I want is income, not one check,\u201d said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., summing up the views of some exiting a long, private meeting of GOP senators on Capitol Hill. One or two checks \u201cmakes no sense to me,\u201d he said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday morning told\u00a0Fox Business Network\u00a0that the White House was looking at payments of $1,000 to most adult Americans within three weeks, as a way to stem the widespread economic damage caused by shuttered businesses and social distancing. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., walk to attend a Republican policy lunch on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, March 19, 2020. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)  Mnuchin also said that if the crisis were still ongoing in six weeks, the federal government would deliver another round of checks worth the same amount of money. The Treasury secretary said Thursday the checks would be direct-deposited into people\u2019s accounts. Though unusual, stimulus checks are not unprecedented. Former President George W. Bush's administration twice successfully pushed for economic stimulus checks. Meanwhile, President Trump on Wednesday signed the\u00a0second\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0relief bill into law\u00a0that provides\u00a0paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans. INSIDE CHINA'S PROPAGANDA PUSH ON CORONAVIRUS The legislation provides\u00a014 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring\u00a0relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered.

        "text": "Games\nThe negotiations between the Republicans and Democrats over a new coronavirus economic relief package are facing new obstacles. White House officials and Democratic leaders remained\u00a0at an impasse Monday over another\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0relief package, with aid for cash-strapped state and local governments emerging as the latest obstacle in negotiations. The two sides are at odds over whether states should receive additional funding in the next round of emergency aid -- and if so, how much. Negotiators are trying to close the divide between the Senate Republicans'\u00a0$1 trillion HEALS Act, which includes no new funding for states, and the House's $3.4 trillion HEROES Act, which allocates\u00a0about $1 trillion\u00a0in new funding for state and local governments. WHAT'S IN TRUMP'S FOUR VIRUS RELIEF EXECUTIVE ORDERS? The stalemate\u00a0puts at risk potentially trillions\u00a0of dollars in aid for families, businesses and the U.S. economy, including a fresh round of $1,200 stimulus checks, extra unemployment aid for millions of\u00a0out-of-work Americans, $100 billion to help reopen schools and relief for cash-strapped state and local governments. There were no signs of a d\u00e9tente\u00a0on Monday, with each party blaming the other for the stalled-out discussions. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, one of the lead White House negotiators, called Democrats' request for $1 trillion for states \"an absurd number,\" saying\u00a0there's \"plenty\" of cash available already for the governments. \"We\u2019re not going to give a trillion dollars for state and local,\" he said during an interview with CNBC on Monday. \"That\u2019s just not a reasonable approach.\" CALCULATE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'D RECEIVE FROM THE SECOND STIMULUS CHECK HERE President Trump lashed out at Democrats for insisting on the inclusion of aid for state and local governments. \"So now Schumer and Pelosi want to meet to make a deal,\" he wrote in a tweet. \"Amazing how it all works, isn't it. Where have they been for the last 4 weeks when they were 'hardliners,' and only wanted BAILOUT MONEY for Democrat-run states and cities that are failing badly? They know my phone number!\" But Democrats warned that without more federal funding, state and local governments -- which combined employ about 23.2 million essential workers -- will be forced to lay off employees and cut essential services. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, speaking from the Senate floor, warned that the \u201ceconomy is failing\u201d and \u201cstate and local governments are cutting essential services.\u201d WHAT A TRUMP PAYROLL TAX DEFERRAL WOULD ACTUALLY MEAN FOR YOUR WALLET \u201cWe\u2019re going to see layoffs, and this is not an abstract concept,\" Schumer said Sunday during an interview with ABC's \"This Week.\" \"You know, the Republicans say \u2018the blue states.\u2019 A firefighter is a firefighter. A person who drives a bus, a person who picks up the garbage\u00a0\u2014 those are important jobs.\" State and local governments, reeling from the loss of tax revenue as a result of the virus-induced recession, are lobbying Congress to allocate billions more in relief. Budget shortfalls could total more than $500 billion in just one year, the Center on Policy and Budget Priorities\u00a0reported. The $2.2 trillion CARES Act approved in late March allocated $150 billion for state and local governments. The Treasury Department's inspector general's office reported in late July that states had spent about one-quarter of that money; however, some state officials said the report did not factor in the money that was already earmarked for spending.

Kudlow\u2019s comments come after a week where the White House\u2019s hoped for payroll tax cuts were shot down by Congress. \"There's a $1,200 check coming. That is going to be part of the new package. I would have preferred a payroll tax cut, on top of that check,\u201d Kudlow said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union. \u201cBut, be that as it may, politically, it doesn't work.\u201d  STIMULUS CHECKS, STATE AID AND MORE: WHAT\u2019S IN HOUSE DEMOCRATS' NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL While no deal has been officially announced, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have been on Capitol Hill recently to discuss the details of a new relief package with congressional leaders. On ending the additional $600 in unemployment benefits the federal government was supplying, Kudlow argued that the extra money was hurting small businesses from hiring workers. \"We have had a flood of inquiries and phone calls and complaints that small stores and businesses, restaurants can't hire people back,\u201d he said. \u201cThey went too far. Maybe last March, it was necessary for that, but, really, there are consequences of people not returning to work.\u201d CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Mnuchin earlier in the day on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d said it a little more bluntly: \"I think workers and Americans understand the concept that you shouldn't be paid more to stay home than to work.\u201d Mnuchin said the new bill will provide additional unemployment benefits, but noted that it will be less than the payments issued under the CARES Act. He said some workers were collecting more than they earned on the job. As a result, when businesses were reopening some employees did not have an incentive to return to work. The secretary said the Trump administration and Senate Republicans are on the same page with a $1 trillion package, but noted that in the interest of passing a bill quickly, issues that are more difficult to negotiate with Democrats could be held off for another bill.

The IRS has sent millions of Americans their coronavirus stimulus payments, but some are not getting the amounts they expected. What should you do if you think your coronavirus stimulus check amount is wrong? What\u00a0do I do if I\u00a0receive too little?\u00a0 The stimulus was an advance on a newly created refundable tax credit for the 2020 tax year. The IRS has stated that if you do not receive the full amount for which you believe you are entitled, you will be able to claim the additional amount on your 2020 tax return. Those who don\u2019t have a filing requirement and have a child (VA and SSI recipients) need to use the non-filers tool at IRS.gov to have the $500 added to their stimulus payment for their child. WHAT TO DO IF A CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS CHECK IS SENT TO SOMEONE WHO DIED\u00a0 What do I do if I\u00a0receive too much?\u00a0 If your tax situation changes in 2020, it\u2019s unlikely the IRS will ask you to pay back a portion next year when you file taxes (there\u2019s no section dedicated to this on their website). However, it\u2019s unclear what will happen if you receive a significantly larger amount.\u00a0 A volunteer firefighter in Indiana was supposed to receive $1,700 in stimulus money but ended up finding $8.2 million in his bank account. Sadly, the mistake was later corrected and the money was taken back. If you received a stimulus check for someone who died, the IRS says you should give it back by sending a check payable to the U.S. Treasury. It's not clear whether recipients are under any legal obligation to return the money. How do I know if I\u00a0received the wrong amount?\u00a0 Single filers should receive $1,200 if they make under $75,000 and joint filers get $2,400 if they make under $150,000. Families get $500 additionally for each dependent child under the age of 16. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Then, your stimulus check is reduced by 5 percent of the amount you make over the phase-out floor. For example, a single filer making $80,000 should receive $950. The check would be reduced by 5 percent of $5,000, or $250. Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

        "text": "Games\nFox Nation host David Webb speaks out as Congress is set to vote on $2,000 stimulus checks. Americans would benefit more from the country reopening safely rather than\u00a0an increase in the amount of money included in coronavirus stimulus checks, Fox News\u00a0contributor David Webb argued on \"Fox & Friends First\" on Monday.  \"The fact is that what America\u00a0doesn\u2019t really need is a\u00a0pittance from our tax dollars\u00a0that we sent to the federal\u00a0government to come back to us\u00a0minus real money,\" the Fox Nation host added. \"What we need is to reopen\u00a0America, reopen America safely.\"  On Monday, House lawmakers are returning to Washington, D.C., to vote on\u00a0raising stimulus checks to\u00a0$2,000, something that President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have pushed for and many Democrats and some Republicans have supported. \"As president, I have told Congress that I want far less wasteful spending and more money going to the American people in the form of $2,000 checks per adult and $600 per child,\" Trump said in a statement issued by White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere on Sunday.\u00a0 President Trump objected to foreign aid in the spending provision of the combination measure \u2013 even though the president requested much of that money in his budget request sent to Congress earlier this year. Many Republicans opposed any stimulus checks, but after wrangling, the sides settled on $600 checks.\u00a0Last week, Trump demanded $2,000 direct payments and refused to sign the legislation into law. House Democrats then prepped a bill to provide for $2,000 payment checks. This bill is expected to be on the floor late Monday.\u00a0 PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNS COVID RELIEF, SPENDING BILL AVERTING SHUTDOWN. SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW? \"We\u2019ve learned a lot about the\u00a0virus.\u00a0Businesses are able to make the\u00a0adjustments locally,\" Webb noted on Monday.  He also addressed concern from critics who believe the stimulus checks will go to people who don\u2019t need\u00a0the money or who shouldn\u2019t get\u00a0the money.  \"There are a lot of people out\u00a0there who will have to pay back\u00a0the money.\u00a0You know who they are?\u00a0All of the taxpayers, our\u00a0children, our grandchildren,\" Webb said.\u00a0 \"We\u2019re literally spending our\u00a0way into more poverty and more\u00a0debt as a country.\u00a0That\u2019s not fair.\"\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

        "text": "Games\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin makes remarks at White House coronavirus task force briefing. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. The Treasury Department said Thursday\u00a0there have been \u201cglitches\u201d in sending the\u00a0coronavirus stimulus payments to Americans who qualified for the relief and said they are \u201cactively\u201d working on ways to remedy the situation. An official from the Treasury Department told Fox News Thursday that the glitches have been related to payments via direct deposit. IRS LAUNCHES 'GET MY PAYMENT' APP TO SPEED UP CORONAVIRUS RELIEF The official said the Treasury Department is actively looking into payments that have yet to be received by those qualifying Americans. This person noted that many who have yet to receive the direct deposit had used H&R Block and Turbo Tax to file their taxes in the past and used the refund anticipation loan programs with the companies. That's a\u00a0service where taxpayers can pay the company a small fee in order to receive your tax refund immediately, versus getting it a week or two after filing. A Treasury official\u00a0said\u00a0the issue is that those\u00a0fast tracked refunds are put on debit cards, which means the IRS doesn\u2019t have the filers direct deposit information.  The official told Fox News that the Treasury is aware of the problem and is actively looking into ways to iron out the issue, while maintaining that the program, in general has been expansive and successful. The Treasury Department\u2019s acknowledgment of the glitches come after The Washington Post first reported that the coronavirus relief checks have yet to hit several million people\u2019s bank accounts, despite the agency\u2019s promise last week that the majority of individuals would receive their payments by the end of the day on April 15. The Post reported that millions of these individuals used popular tax filing services in the past, and thus, the IRS did not have their direct deposit information on file. Several million people who filed their taxes via H&R Block, TurboTax and other popular services were unable to get their payments because the IRS did not have their direct deposit information on file, according to the Treasury, companies and experts. CORONAVIRUS CHECKS ARE ON THEIR WAY: HERE'S HOW IT WORKS The IRS on Wednesday launched an online tool, the \u201cGet My Payment\u201d app, to allow taxpayers to give the agency their direct deposit information to help speed up the coronavirus relief payments to Americans. The majority of eligible Americans \u2013\u00a0more than 80 million, according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2013\u00a0who filed their taxes in 2018 and/or 2019 and received a refund via direct deposit had received their stimulus relief payments by Wednesday. Those who do not file taxes are also now able to go to the IRS website and use the \u201cNon-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here\u201d section to enter their bank information in\u00a0order to receive their payment faster than they would via regular mail. Some Americans can expect to receive paper checks in the mail, but that method of delivery could take months. As part of the CARES Act, people who file their taxes as individuals are eligible for payments up to $1,200, and couples who file jointly are eligible for up to $2,400 plus an\u00a0additional $500 per child under the age of 17. The amount decreases for individuals who earn an adjusted gross income of\u00a0more than $75,000 and couples who earn more than $150,000 a year, by $5 for every $100 in income above those marks. This means the payment is less the higher their earnings are, with it being reduced to zero for individuals\u00a0who make $99,000 or more and couples who make $198,000 or more. People who file as heads of household\u00a0are eligible for payments of up to $1,200 plus $500 per child under 17. That amount is reduced for people who earn an adjusted gross income of more than $112,000 a year. The extent to which it is decreased depends on how many children they have. Payment amounts may also be offset by any past due child support payments that have been reported to the Treasury Department. The payments\u00a0do not count as taxable income. Similarly, they do not count for determining eligibility for federal programs like Supplemental Security Income.

        "text": "Games\nRepublicans and Democrats hold fast to several sticking points holding up the coronavirus relief package; congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports. White House officials and top Democrats are no closer to breaking the impasse over another coronavirus relief package, almost one week after the high-stakes talks\u00a0collapsed. The\u00a0stalemate\u00a0over the next rescue bill\u00a0appears likely to drag on for weeks, possibly into September, putting at risk potentially trillions of dollars in aid amid a pandemic that's infected more than 5 million and led to economic devastation, with 30 million people receiving unemployment benefits. Both sides indicated on Thursday that an agreement is still out of reach after six days of no in-person meetings. Democrats are now saying they will only sit down with Republicans if they agree to a $2 trillion price tag. WHITE HOUSE, DEMS 'MILES APART' OVER VIRUS AID PACKAGE, PELOSI SAYS Asked Thursday when she thought she might speak with Republicans again, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters: \"I don\u2019t know. When they come in with $2 trillion.\" In addition to specific policy measures like money for state governments and the Postal Service, one of the biggest points of contention between the parties is the cost of the proposal. House Democrats passed a roughly $3 trillion bill in May, while Senate Republicans responded with legislation worth about $1 trillion at the end of July. The Trump administration rejected an offer by Pelosi last week to meet in the middle at\u00a0$2 trillion. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the $2 trillion figure a \"non-starter,\" and has called on Democrats to return to the bargaining table and compromise on a $1 trillion package. WASHINGTON IMPASSE ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF THREATENS US ECONOMY \"My view on negotiations\u00a0is you agree on the things that you can agree on, half legislation that's\u00a0good for the American public, and then come back for another bill,\" Mnuchin told FOX Business' on Wednesday. Mnuchin declined to say whether he thought there would be a deal or not. Talks between the two sides\u00a0broke down last Friday, casting fresh uncertainty on a second\u00a0round of $1,200 stimulus checks, extra unemployment aid for millions of\u00a0out-of-work Americans and\u00a0$100 billion to help safely reopen schools. The Senate is now scheduled to be in recess until Labor Day, after technically remaining in session an extra week. But most members returned to their home districts last week. House lawmakers left last week and are not slated to return until the second week of September. Lawmakers will be given 24 hours notice if they need to return to the Capitol to vote on a deal. President Trump, facing a deadlocked\u00a0Congress, issued\u00a0a series of\u00a0executive actions on Saturday that he said would address the economic fallout from the pandemic. SECOND STIMULUS CHECK MAY NOT GO OUT UNTIL SEPTEMBER AS RELIEF TALKS DRAG ON The measures would postpone the collection of payroll taxes for individuals earning less than $104,000 annually through the remainder of the year; partially restore supplemental unemployment benefits at $400 per week (25% of which would come\u00a0from cash-strapped state's budgets), extend student loan relief and discourage evictions. Trump has vowed\u00a0to forgive any taxes that are deferred, but without legislation, those payments will still be required by the delayed due date. Some of his proposals are expected to\u00a0face legal challenges. The Constitution gives Congress the power of federal spending, meaning that Trump does not have the legal authority to issue executive orders allocating\u00a0how much money should be spent on the pandemic.

        "text": "Games\nUniversity of Maryland professor Peter Morici weighs in on the stimulus showdown. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0on Wednesday blasted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for holding up $2,000 stimulus checks that both Democrats and President Trump support.\u00a0 The House passed bipartisan legislation earlier this week to boost the forthcoming coronavirus stimulus payments from $600 to $2,000 after Trump demanded it, but McConnell blocked a quick vote on that stand-alone legislation Tuesday.\u00a0 130 HOUSE REPUBLICANS, 2 DEMOCRATS VOTE AGAINST $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS \"It's amazing to see the patience that some people have with other people's suffering,\" Pelosi said at a news conference Wednesday. \"These Republicans in the Senate seem to have an endless tolerance.\" \"We urge Mitch McConnell to stop his obstruction\u00a0and to bring that legislation to the floor of the Senate,\" Pelosi added. McConnell has not committed to bringing the $2,000 checks up for a vote. Instead, he wants to link the $2,000 stimulus checks to two other hot-button pieces of legislation \u2014\u00a0repealing Section 230 of the Communications\u00a0Decency\u00a0Act that Trump wants to hit Big Tech with, and measures to investigate Trump's election security claims.\u00a0 \"Those are the three important subjects the president has linked together,\" McConnell said Tuesday.\u00a0\"This week the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus.\" MCCONNELL INTRODUCES HIS OWN BILL ON $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS, OTHER TRUMP PRIORITIES Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said this was McConnell's latest attempt to deprive Americans of bigger checks. \"Senator McConnell knows how to make $2,000 survival checks reality and he knows how to kill them,\" Schumer said.\u00a0 In other news,\u00a0Pelosi said Wednesday she'd\u00a0be forming a new select committee to address economic disparities.\u00a0 Pelosi also brushed off a GOP effort to challenge the certification of the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6 during a Joint Session of Congress, saying that she has \"no doubt\" President-elect Joe Biden will become the next president.\u00a0 DEMOCRATS SEIZE ON MCCONNELL'S STIMULUS BLOCK IN GEORGIA RUNOFF Pelosi announced that\u00a0Rep.-elect Mariannette Miller-Meeks would still be sworn in on Sunday with the rest of Congress despite the ongoing challenge to her six-vote win in Iowa. The provisional swearing-in doesn't preclude the House from still investigating the election challenge from Democrat Rita Hart. \"Every vote counts and that\u2019s why the Committee on House Administration is conducting a thorough and fair review of this election to make sure every vote was counted and counted as cast,\" Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill added. \"Pending the outcome of the Committee\u2019s review and consistent with House practice, we intend to provisionally seat the Republican candidate on Sunday.\" Marisa Schultz is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital.

        "text": "Games\nCriminal Defense Attorney Brian Claypool joins Trace Gallagher to discuss the Florida Governor's decision to issue quarantine to anyone traveling from New York. Florida resident Thomas Andrews is sounding the alarm after receiving a suspicious official-looking envelope in the mail on Thursday. The envelope read \"Time-Sensitive Fast-Tracked Open Immediately\" on the top, and on the bottom right: \"Important COVID-19 Economic Stimulus Document Enclosed.\" Inside turned out to be a fake check with the line \"Stimulus Relief Program\"\u00a0printed in the top left corner and made out for more than $3,000. Andrews told FOX 35: \"The check paper itself is really misleading. Even on the back, looking like you just sign the back like any real check.\" CLICK FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK Andrews said: \"Just the address that says they will only be there temporarily with a tent until April 5. But if you really read it, you'll see it's talking about selling cars and such. But they even call their tent a 'relief headquarters.'\" \"Many people, especially the elderly, won't read/understand this and will be driving there thinking they will be getting relief money only to be harassed by a car salesman.\" The historic\u00a0$2 trillion coronavirus relief package\u00a0that President Trump\u00a0signed into law Friday is set to give companies and families a cash cushion to better weather the health crisis and looming recession. When it\u2019s safe to go back to work, dine out and book airline tickets again, the thinking goes, they\u2019ll be more financially ready to return to something closer to normal life. Congress is sending a one-time payment directly to most American adults and U.S. residents with Social Security numbers. That amounts to $1,200 for single adults earning up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 for married couples earning up to $150,000, plus $500 per child. Someone filing as head of household would get the full payment if they earn $112,500 or less. The payment is reduced by $5 for each $100 that a taxpayer\u2019s income exceeds those thresholds, and is completely phased-out for single filers with incomes exceeding $99,000, or $146,500 for head of household filers with one child, and $198,000 for joint filers with no children. The package will also help replace the earnings of unemployed workers for four months, providing them with their state\u2019s unemployment benefits plus an extra $600 a week. For the first time, gig economy workers such as Uber drivers can claim unemployment benefits, too. The support for individuals and households is especially important because the social safety net in America isn\u2019t as strong as it is in the wealthy developed countries of Europe. The package includes $50 billion in tax credits for businesses that keep employees on payroll and will cover 50 percent of those workers\u2019 paychecks. Companies can also defer payment of the 6.2 percent\u00a0Social Security tax, giving them an incentive to put off layoffs at a time when ordinary business has come to a halt.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin announced on Thursday that the first round of stimulus checks will be directly deposited into Americans\u2019 bank accounts in the next two weeks.  When the checks -- a key part of the massive $2.2. trillion coronavirus stimulus bill that President Trump signed last week --\u00a0will be sent out has been a major subject of debate as the U.S. economy continues to reel from the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. There had been rumors that it could five weeks to get the first checks out, but Mnuchin said previously said it would take three weeks. \u201cI told you it would be three weeks, now I\u2019m telling you it will be two weeks,\u201d Mnuchin said during a press briefing on Thursday. \u201cIt is not going to take five weeks, I\u2019m assuring the American public. They need the money now.\" TRUMP SLAMS \u2018PARTISAN INVESTIGATIONS\u2018 AFTER PELOSI ANNOUNCES NEW COMMITTEE ON CORONAVIRUS CRISIS: \u2018HERE WE GO AGAIN\u2019 People who file their taxes as individuals are eligible for payments up to $1,200, but that decreases for people who earn an adjusted gross income of\u00a0more than $75,000 a year.\u00a0The bill says that the payment is reduced by five percent of every dollar above that mark, or $50 for every $1,000 above $75,000. What that ultimately means is that for people who make more than $75,000 the payment is less the higher their earnings are, with it being reduced to zero for those who make $99,000 or more. Married couples who file\u00a0a joint tax return are eligible for a payment of up to $2,400, plus and additional $500 per child. However, that amount decreases for couples whose adjusted gross income is more than $150,000 in a year at the same rate of 5 percent of every dollar above that mark. This translates to less money the more people make, with it being reduced to zero for joint filers without children who earn $198,000 or more. A family would receive $500 per child.  CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN There has been a great deal of concern about people who don\u2019t file tax returns or who don\u2019t have bank accounts. Mnuchin said he concerned about people who are \u201cunderbanked,\u201d and said the administration will send checks to those who don\u2019t have bank accounts.  The treasury secretary added, however, that the federal government prefers to deposit the stimulus directly into people\u2019s bank accounts given the current public health crisis. \u201cWe can process a lot of checks but we don\u2019t want to send checks in this environment,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to put the money directly into people\u2019s accounts.\u201d The main way people contract the coronavirus is through touching surfaces or items in which an infected person has also touched.  Recent studies have found that the virus can live up to 24\u00a0hours on cardboard and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel. When aerosolized into fine, floating particles \u2013 via a cough or sneeze, for example - the virus remained viable for three hours. This is why public health officials are warning Americans to frequently disinfect commonly touched surfaces and to wash your hands multiple times a day with soap and water for at least twenty seconds. Vice President Mike Pence noted that\u00a0the president will announce a plan Friday to pay for uninsured Americans to get coronavirus treatment -- using some of the $100 billion allotted to hospitals in the recent stimulus bill During the press conference, President Trump also said Wednesday that he had invoked the Defense Protection Act to force 3M to ramp up the production of N95 respirator masks, which are urgently needed by health care workers across the country. 3M\u00a0Chief Executive Mike Roman said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that\u00a0it will be months before the company\u00a0meet the demands needed during the pandemic. CLICK FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK 3M and\u00a0half dozen smaller competitors are making about 50 million of N95 masks each month, which falls far short of the\u00a0300 million masks the Department of Health and Human Services estimated in March that health-care workers in the country would need monthly to fight the contagion. \u201cThe demand we have exceeds our production capacity,\u201d 3M Chief Executive Mike Roman told the Wall Street Journal, adding that the company doubled its mask production since January. Trump also announced that he had received a second COVID-19 test, which came back negative. He said the new test was much quick and \u201cpleasant\u201d than the first one he was administered.  \u201cI took it this morning, it took me literally a minute to take it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt said the president tested negative for COVID-19.\u201d The president spent part of the press conference railing against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and other Democrats for forming a\u00a0new House committee with subpoena authority to investigate the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic.  \"We have seen Americans unite with incredible selflessness and compassion,\" Trump said. \"I want to remind everyone here in our nation's capital, especially in Congress, that this is not the time for politics, endless partisan investigations.

The bipartisan coronavirus\u00a0relief bill extends a moratorium on evictions for people who can't pay their rent,\u00a0but it doesn't include a\u00a0federal stimulus check, Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said Sunday. Cassidy, one of 10 senators drafting the proposed package, said he hopes\u00a0that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and President Trump will sign off on it. While final language\u00a0is expected to be hammered out early this week, one item that will not be included is a second round of direct payments to Americans. US SETS NEW SINGLE-DAY RECORD WITH 227,885 CORONAVIRUS CASES FRIDAY \"It may be a go, but it\u2019s not in this bill,\" Cassidy told \"Fox News Sunday,\"\u00a0 \"This is not a stimulus bill, it\u2019s a relief bill,\" he said. \"...There may be a stimulus check, but that would be part of a different piece of legislation.\" The roughly $900\u00a0billion proposal\u00a0being pushed by\u00a0the senators \u2014 including Joe Manchin, D-W.V.;\u00a0Susan Collins, R-Maine; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska;\u00a0Mitt Romney, R-Utah;\u00a0Maggie Hassan, D-N.H.;\u00a0Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.;\u00a0Angus King, I-Maine;\u00a0and Mark Warner, D-Va. \u2014 represents a compromise between the $500 billion package backed by McConnell\u00a0and the $2.2 trillion plan\u00a0sought by Democrats. The bipartisan group\u00a0is proposing an extension of the moratorium on evictions, which provides protection\u00a0against people who cannot afford to pay their rent. At the same time, Cassidy said, they want to protect landlords as well. Cassidy said that \"one of the sticking points\" in negotiations over the bill is liability protection for small businesses that would allow them to be open without worrying that they will be sued by customers who contract COVID-19. JOSH HAWLEY, AOC AGREE: CORONAVIRUS RELIEF MUST INCLUDE STIMULUS CHECKS \"There has to be some liability protection,\" Cassidy said, citing mixed messages early on about the need for customers and employees to wear masks. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The senator said he is confident that Trump and McConnell will accept the compromise relief package, which he believes is urgently needed. \"The pain of the American people is driving this, and I\u2019m optimistic that both of those leaders will come on board,\" he said.

        "text": "Games\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell provides updates on the coronavirus funding bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled Thursday that the third phase of Congress\u2019 coronavirus response plan would aim to deliver stimulus checks to the majority of Americans in a bid to provide relief to families under economic strain \u201cas rapidly as possible.\u201d McConnell, R-Ky., speaking on the floor, outlined the emerging Senate GOP proposal to provide \u201cdirect financial help\u201d as the nation grapples with the\u00a0COVID-19 global pandemic. MNUCHIN SAYS WH LOOKING TO SEND $1,000 CHECKS TO MOST AMERICANS WITHIN 3 WEEKS\u00a0 \u201cSenate Republicans want to put cash in the hands of the American people,\u201d McConnell said Thursday, noting that lawmakers are currently finalizing a structure that can quickly send assistance to Americans. An outstanding question has been whether the aid would be restricted based on income and work status. McConnell indicated job status would not be a factor, and that the money would go to unemployed workers and those recently laid off; those\u00a0still working; and retirees, even if they're already receiving Social Security checks. While officials have indicated the ultra-rich would not be eligible, McConnell said Thursday the checks would still go to everybody \"from the middle class on down. Period.\" How the middle class is defined can be a contentious subject when stimulus checks are on the line.\u00a0One source told Fox Business Network that the amount\u00a0would start to reduce for those making $75,000 and above -- and the checks would be limited to those who make $99,000 or less. \u201cThis is something we want to do right away,\u201d McConnell said on the floor. \u201cThis is not an ordinary policy, but this is not an ordinary time.\u201d He added: \u201cThe American people need help and they need it fast. This will deliver it.\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday morning told Fox Business Network that the White House is looking at payments of $1,000 to most adult Americans within three weeks, and an additional $500 for children. A family of four would receive as much as $3,000. Mnuchin also said that if the crisis were still ongoing in six weeks, the federal government would deliver another round of checks worth the same amount of money. But sources familiar with the negotiations between Congress and the Treasury Department later told FBN\u00a0on Thursday that the Senate is now looking to deliver more than that per person. Sources said that senators are weighing delivering $1,200 per adult in the U.S. in two payments, and an additional $500 for children. Negotiations, though, are ongoing. SENATE DEMS PROPOSE SUSPENDING FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK Mnuchin said earlier this week that it was \u201cclear we don\u2019t need to send people who make a million dollars a year checks.\u201d Meanwhile, McConnell\u2019s new proposal also includes relief and support for small businesses, and would provide \u201cnew federally guaranteed loans\u201d that he said would \u201caddress immediate cash flow problems.\u201d McConnell also said that the Senate was working to let \u201cqualified\u201d small businesses get liquidity through \u201cfamiliar institutions\u201d like their community banks. He added that the relief for small businesses would help them to \u201cendure, help workers keep their jobs, and businesses and workers emerge from this ready to thrive.\u201d The Senate is also looking at implementing \u201ctargeted lending\u201d to industries of national importance, like the airline industry. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about so-called bailouts for firms that made reckless decisions,\u201d McConnell said, referencing the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cNo one is alleging a moral hazard here.\u201d \u201cNone of these firms, not corner stores, pizza parlors, not airlines, brought this on themselves,\"\u00a0he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about a taxpayer-funded cushion for companies that made mistakes. We\u2019re talking about loans that must be repaid.\u201d McConnell also said the new proposal would give more resources to those in the medical field and healthcare industry, and would \u201cremove barriers to care, speed innovation, fund hospitals and health centers to treat patients and expand health care workers access to the tools they need.\u201d Meanwhile, President Trump on Wednesday signed the\u00a0second\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0relief bill into law\u00a0that provides\u00a0paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans. The legislation provides\u00a014 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states. The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring\u00a0relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered. As of Thursday afternoon, the U.S.\u00a0had\u00a0more than 10,700 confirmed cases of coronavirus in all 50 states, including Washington, D.C. The U.S., so far, has seen 154\u00a0COVID-19-related deaths. The Trump administration\u2019s task force predicted Tuesday that the number of cases in the U.S. could peak in about\u00a045 days.

President Biden on Thursday ignored a question about the timing of stimulus checks, after promising the American people earlier this year that they would receive $2,000 checks immediately if Democrats won the Senate. Fox News\u2019 Peter Doocy asked Biden about this promise at the conclusion of an event where the president made remarks commemorating 50 million vaccine doses administered in the U.S. in 37 days. \"Mr. President, whatever happened to your promise from seven weeks ago that if Democrats flipped the Senate the checks were going out the door?\" Doocy can be heard asking. Biden did not answer any questions from the media but returned to the podium to retrieve his mask, which he appeared to have forgotten to put back on. KENNEDY: BIDEN CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILL IS 'CHOCK-FULL OF SPENDING PORN' The president told voters while campaigning in Atlanta in January that $2,000 checks would be imminent if the Democratic Senate candidates won their runoff races. \"Their election will put an end to the block in Washington on that $2,000 stimulus check \u2013 that money will go out the door immediately to help people who are in real trouble,\" Biden told the crowd. Both Democrats won their runoff races, effectively giving the party a majority in the Senate, considering the tiebreaking vote would be cast by Vice President Kamala Harris. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats are currently working on a $1.9 trillion relief package, which includes a round of $1,400 direct payments to American households. A vote in the House could take place within the coming days. The package, which does not have bipartisan support, could move along via a fast-track process known as budget reconciliation, whereby Democrats can pass certain spending measures without any Republican approval. The legislation also includes aid to state and local governments, money for vaccine distribution and expanded unemployment benefits. Lawmakers are hoping to pass the relief package by mid-March, when federal unemployment insurance benefits are set to expire.

        "text": "Games\n'Special Report' anchor Bret Baier breaks down the new COVID relief bill, White House press briefing ethics, Vice President Kamala Harris's West Virginia mistake, and more on 'America Reports.' Democrats inched closer toward passing their $1.9 trillion relief package along a path that requires no Republican support on Thursday, though the process was put on a brief pause as lawmakers carried out a budget \"vote-a-rama.\" The marathon voting process began at the conclusion of a debate on the budget resolution, giving Republicans a chance to flex some political might. Before Democrats can move forward with their budget resolution, the chamber must vote on all measures brought forth by members during the vote-a-rama.  Once the budget resolution is approved, Democrats will have the tools they need to proceed with their COVID relief package plans without Republican support \u2013 assuming all members of the party are on board. The amendments proposed will not alter U.S. policy regardless of whether they pass. Approved budget resolutions are not technically law, and the amendments are also nonbinding and will have no effect on Democrats\u2019 underlying relief proposal.  Instead, they tend to serve as a litmus test to gauge support for various proposals, or as a way for the minority party to force the majority party on record regarding controversial topics, which can provide fodder for campaign attacks in subsequent election cycles. Any senator is able to propose an amendment on the resolution, and voting is not expected to conclude until Friday morning.  SENATE DEMS SIGNAL SUPPORT FOR SENDING STIMULUS CASH TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS Here\u2019s a look at some of the amendments lawmakers considered on Thursday: Tax increases on small businesses Sens. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Tim Scott, R-S.C., proposed an amendment to prohibit tax increases on small businesses. It would specifically prevent any tax hike legislation from being passed through budget reconciliation during the pandemic. This amendment was adopted unanimously. Reopening schools after teachers are vaccinated An amendment posed by Sens. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Tim Scott, R-S.C., which would withhold emergency funding from schools that did not reopen for in-person learning after teachers had been offered the COVID-19 vaccine, was not agreed to. The vote count came to an even 50-50 partisan split, which failed by rule. A separate measure related to schools was introduced by Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wy., designed to\u00a0provide funding to schools in states that are expected to lose revenue due to the Biden administration\u2019s moratorium on oil and natural gas leasing on public lands and off-shore waters. This amendment passed 98 to 2. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Remote work taxation Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., introduced an amendment to simplify the tax filing process for people who have been working remotely during the pandemic. The amendment, which was adopted, contains a number of provisions that affect people who have been working in a different state than their office location.\u00a0It also notably provides frontline workers who crossed state borders in order to help patients in hard-hit states, like New York, with an extended moratorium on income taxes in the new state. That is intended to prevent these people from facing\u00a0surprise tax bills\u00a0for their essential work. Stimulus checks to illegal immigrants Sens. Todd Young, R-Ind., and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., proposed an amendment that would prohibit any future economic impact payments from being sent to illegal immigrants. The amendment was adopted, but 42 lawmakers voted against it. As previously reported by Fox News, House Democrats proposed a bill toward the end of last year that would have provided checks to some illegal immigrants. Sens. Joe Manchin, W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Me., introduced another amendment regarding stimulus checks, which would target them to households that need it the most. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., was the only dissenting vote on that measure. Fox News\u2019 Caroline McKee contributed to this report.

Senate Republicans unveiled their version of a fresh round of coronavirus relief on Monday, as White House negotiators and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are set to meet in the evening to begin negotiations. \u201cSo I hope this strong proposal will occasion a real response. Not partisan cheap shots. Not the predictable, tired, old rhetoric as though these were ordinary times and the nation could afford ordinary politics,\u201d Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in unveiling the HEALS Act. The $1 trillion Republican bill is the alternative to the House\u2019s HEROES act, the $3 trillion relief legislation passed in May. HEALS stands for the package\u2019s focus on Health, Economic Assistance, Liability protection, and Schools. The HEALS Act is more targeted than the CARES act, tailored to an economy that has \u201cone foot in the pandemic and one foot in the recovery,\u201d according to McConnell. The relief legislation includes $105\u00a0billion in school funding, more than the House offered in its proposal, with the goal of retrofitting schools and universities with coronavirus precautions to open for on-campus learning. FISCAL CONSERVATIVES REVOLT OVER PRICETAG OF CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE\u00a0 It also includes a second round of stimulus checks at the same $1200 amount as in the CARES act, along with a \u201csequel\u201d to the Paycheck Protection Program to mitigate layoffs. Federal unemployment benefits would be extended, but at an additional $200 per week rather than the $600 that the CARES Act offered. That number would run through the first week of October, at which point states are supposed to bring a more complicated program online where those who are still unemployed can collect 70 percent of their former wages. \u201cThe boosted unemployment benefit is significantly more than the Democratic Senate and President approved in the 2009 economic crisis, and it doesn\u2019t pay most people more than working like the extra $600 does,\u201d Sen. Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said. McConnell noted that the additional $200 was still eight times the $25 per week in federal benefits offered following the 2008 recession. Liability protections would be included for everyone from doctors and nurses, who will be protected from malpractice suits, to churches, charities, businesses and schools, McConnell noted. The hope is that the protections will encourage companies to reopen without fear that they will spend years in court. The bill also includes $16 billion for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing; $20 billion for vaccine, therapeutic and diagnostic development; $20 billion for farmers and $30 billion to protect the military and defense industrial base from the virus. McConnell delayed unveiling the legislation last week after he said the White House had requested more time to review it. Trump had long pushed for a payroll tax cut to spur hiring, but ultimately Republicans opted for direct stimulus payments instead. The Democratic leader in the Senate, Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, blasted the legislation as \u201ctotally inadequate.\u201d \u201cWe've waited months for a Republican bill and still\u00a0the Republican response is totally inadequate,\u201d the New York Democrat said on the Senate floor. He criticized the Republican plan for offering\u00a0the unemployed 70 percent of their former wages. \u201cRepublicans say take a 30 percent\u00a0pay cut. Can you believe that? You lost your job, can't get to work, and now they want to take $1600 out of your pocket every month,\u201d Schumer said. McConnell urged Democrats to put aside their \u201csocialist manifesto,\u201d the HEROES Act, and come to the negotiating table. \u201cThe Senate will not waste time with pointless partisanship,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a reason why even Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer themselves have publicly downplayed the multi-trillion-dollar socialist manifesto they published some weeks back, and have suggested the real, serious discussion would begin when Republicans released our outline.\u201d \u201cAre we going to get the Democratic Party we got in March, when our colleagues met us in good-faith negotiations and worked with us to turn our framework into a bipartisan product?\u201d McConnell continued.\u201cOr will the country get the Democratic Party we saw in June, when our colleagues refused to suggest amendments or improvements to Senator Tim Scott\u2019s police reform bill, and chose to block the issue altogether?\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He said Democrats\u2019 failure to negotiate with Republicans on police reform left some wondering whether they had chosen to \u201cgive up on bipartisan legislation altogether through November.\u201d Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox Subscribed You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92025 FOX News Network, LLC.

Negotiations between House Democrats and the White House on a second coronavirus stimulus package for Americans who are struggling to stay afloat have been stalled for weeks. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows signaled a possible move toward restarting talks when he told Politico on Wednesday that his staff has reached out to\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's staff. But even on that point, there is disagreement. \u201cWe've reached out,\" Meadows told Politico Playbook\u00a0on Wednesday. \"I\u00a0actually had my staff reach out again yesterday to Speaker Pelosi's chief of staff to say that we haven't heard anything from her. \u2026 The president wants [a deal], but I'm not optimistic.\" WASHINGTON IMPASSE ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF THREATENS US ECONOMY He added that he thinks Pelosi \"is going to hold out until the end of September and try to get what she wants in the funding for the government during the [continuing resolution] or whatever funding mechanism happens to come up at the end of September.\" But Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hamill, said Meadows' staff did not directly ask for more negotiations in a text message, only that they asked if Pelosi's team had the correct phone number. Meadows said on ABC News' \"This Week\" that he would contact Pelosi last Sunday, but Hamill said he\u00a0never did. STIMULUS TALKS COULD DRAG INTO SEPTEMBER AS NEGOTIATIONS HIT WALL OVER AID DEAL \"Democrats have compromised in these negotiations,\" Hamill told Fox News.\u00a0\"We offered to come down $1 trillion if the White House would come up $1 trillion.\u00a0We welcome the White House back to the negotiating table but they must meet us halfway.\" The House passed a $3 trillion, 1,800-page HEROES Act\u00a0in May \u2014 more than 100 days ago \u2014 that would include $1,200 checks for all Americans and undocumented immigrants, $25 billion in additional\u00a0funding for the U.S. Postal Service and $600-per-week unemployment benefits. President Trump's name is seen on a stimulus check issued by the IRS to help combat the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak. (AP Photo/Eric Gay)  The HEROES Act is\u00a0the most expensive piece of legislation ever passed since President Trump signed the bipartisan $2 trillion CARES Act in March, which allocated $1,200 checks to all Americans. Senate Republicans introduced the\u00a0$1 trillion HEALS Act\u00a0\u2014 which would also include $1,200 checks \u2014 in July, but they are working to release a new, scaled-back proposal\u00a0of the legislation\u00a0that would not include stimulus checks but would include $10 billion in\u00a0for the U.S. Postal Service and $300 weekly unemployment benefits, Politico reported earlier this month. WHITE HOUSE, DEMS 'MILES APART' OVER VIRUS AID PACKAGE, PELOSI SAYS Meadows also indicated that the White House is interested in providing aid to airlines. \"I talked to \u2026 United, American and Delta, all three of them. And any time that you can keep employers with employees not being furloughed or laid off is a good thing. And so we've raised this issue. It would take a CARES package, I believe, to do it,\" he told Politico. Senators return\u00a0from recess on Sept. 8 and representatives on Sept. 14. Congress has until Sept. 30 to propose a budget plan for fiscal year 2021. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News' Caroline McKee contributed to this report.

The White House is pushing for a congressional compromise on U.S. Postal Service funding and stimulus checks for individuals as House Democrats decry President Trump's threat to withhold funding for USPS and link it to the administration's opposition to universal mail-in voting. TRUMP SAYS HE'S WILLING TO GIVE USPS MONEY IF DEMS CONCEDE TO 'SOME' FUNDING ASKS IN CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE \"If my Democrat friends are all upset about this, come back to Washington, D.C.,\" White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"Let's go ahead and get a stimulus check out to Americans. Let's make sure that small businesses are protected with an extended [Payroll Protection]\u00a0Program and put the postal funding in there. We'll pass it tomorrow. The president will sign it.\" \"This will all go away because what we are seeing is Democrats are trying to use this to their political advantage,\" Meadows continued. The House of Representatives is in recess for the rest of August. However, a\u00a0senior member of House Democratic leadership told\u00a0Fox News\u00a0that it's a matter of \u201cwhen not if\u201d they come back this week or next to focus on USPS funding and, possibly,\u00a0coronavirus relief funding. NJ GOVERNOR 'UNEQUIVOCALLY' SUPPORTS MORE FUNDING FOR POSTAL SYSTEM AFTER MAIL-IN VOTING ANNOUNCEMENT Meadows insisted that possible voter fraud, not strain on USPS, is what should give Americans pause about choosing the route of universal mail-in voting this November. The Postal Service processes and delivers more than 181 million pieces of first-class mail every day. Erica Koesler, left, and David Haerle, both of Los Angeles, demonstrate outside a USPS post office, Saturday, Aug. 15, 2020, in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Chris Pizzello)  \"Even if every single voter voted by mail, we're talking about a 1.5% difference,\" Meadows said. \"I was in the room when the Postmaster General said he's willing to pay overtime to make sure that that happens.\" \"What he opposes is universal mail-in ballots where you send millions of ballots out to registered voters across the country, even those that don't request it,\" he said.\u00a0\"Those rolls are not accurate. People move, people die. And yet when we are going to send out ballots all across the country, that's not just asking for a disaster. It really is knowing that what you're sending out is inaccurate.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Such a \"disaster\" could mean months of not knowing the results of the 2020 presidential election, which could lead to the House, which is currently held by Democrats, deciding who becomes president if neither candidate wins a majority in the electoral college,\u00a0Meadows said. Fox News\u2019 John Roberts on Friday asked Trump if he would be willing to offer the $25 billion for the ailing USPS, including $3.5 billion in election resources, should Democrats be willing to cave on some of the demands Trump has voiced. \u201cSure, if they give us what we want,\u201d the president said during a press conference. \u201cAnd it's not what I want, it's what the American people want.\u201d Fox News' Chad Pergram, Leland Vittert and Morgan Phillips\u00a0contributed to this report.

Senate Democrats cleared the way for convicted murderers like Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to receive stimulus checks when they passed the American Rescue Plan of 2021 last March without a GOP amendment that would have blocked inmates from receiving the checks.\u00a0 Tsarnaev\u00a0has been ordered by prosecutors to return a $1,400 COVID-19 relief payment he received last summer along with other money sent to him, according to a court filing Wednesday.\u00a0 BOSTON MARATHON BOMBER ORDERED TO RETURN $1,400 CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PAYMENT TO VICTIMS FOR RESTITUTION This combination of undated file photos shows the two brothers the FBI initially said were suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing on Monday, April 15, 2013, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, left, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19.\u00a0 (The Associated Press) Tsarnaev so far has only paid $2,202.03 of the more than $101 million in restitution\u00a0owed to his victims. The filing said the $1,400 in COVID-19 relief money should instead be used as restitution. Tsarnaev\u00a0was sentenced to death two years after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, which left three people dead and hundreds hurt. The death sentence was overturned in 2020 after a court ruled that a trial judge erred by excluding some evidence. An appeal to reinstate his death sentence is before the U.S. Supreme Court. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., warned in March that convicts like Tsarnaev\u00a0would benefit from the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, which included $1,400 stimulus checks for individuals making less than $75,000.\u00a0 \"Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston Bomber, murdered three people and terrorized a city,\" Cotton wrote in a March 6 tweet. \"He'll be getting a $1,400 stimulus check as part of the Democrats' \u2018COVID relief\u2019 bill.\" Cotton, along with Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and\u00a0Ted Cruz, R-Texas, offered an amendment on the floor at the time to block checks from prisoners, but it failed on a party-line vote, 49-50. Both Cotton and Cassidy voted in favor of two COVID-19 relief bills under the Trump administration that also did not exclude prisoners from receiving stimulus checks. Cruz voted against both bills that offered $1,200 and $600 checks.\u00a0 In this courtroom sketch, Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty is depicted pointing to defendant Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, right, during closing arguments in Tsarnaev's federal death penalty trial Monday, April 6, 2015, in Boston.\u00a0 (The Associated Press) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., argued in March that prisoners' children could be affected by withholding the money from them. Democrats pushed through the legislation in a party-line vote of 50-49 on March 6. The final amended bill was passed by the House a few days later, with Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, as the sole Democrat to vote with Republicans, and President Biden signed the bill into law on March 11.

McConnell said he supports another round of stimulus checks for Americans as he believes the 'economy needs another shot of adrenaline.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday made clear\u00a0he supports another round of stimulus checks to Americans. The economy needs \u201canother shot of adrenaline\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic, he said. McConnell, R-Ky., has been in negotiations with top congressional Democrats and the White House on what the next coronavirus bill would look like, as the Trump administration is pushing a package with a price tag of $1 trillion. McConnell said he supports \u201canother round of direct payments\u201d to Americans \u2013\u00a0something President Trump and top members of his administration have said they, too, support. MNUCHIN SAYS LEADERS ARE 'STARTING WITH ANOTHER TRILLION DOLLARS' FOR NEXT CORONAVIRUS PACKAGE \u201cThe economy needs another shot of adrenaline,\u201d McConnell said Tuesday. \u201cIf we lose control of the virus\u2026everything else will be window dressing.\u201d Sources told Fox News this week that an emphasis would be put on liability protections\u00a0and \u201caddressing unemployment insurance in a proper way.\u201d The key to Republican support for the package is making sure those who are without work do not make more on unemployment than they would if they were working. The additional unemployment benefit of $600 a week approved in the third coronavirus package will expire Aug. 1. Meanwhile, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said it was \"cruel-hearted and callous\" to cut off the additional unemployment benefits without extending the program, and a \"failure of leadership in the Senate and in the White House.\" Jeffries noted\u00a0the House bill, passed in May, extended those benefits, which he said \"is appropriate because the pandemic is not over and in many parts of the country, is just getting started.\" As for liability protections, McConnell said he was focused on \u201ccreating a safe harbor\u201d for firms, universities and small businesses \u201cif we want any genuine reopening at all.\u201d \u201cWe need to carve out a new normal,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back to April.\u201d McConnell reiterated that he believed the new plan being pushed by Republicans would score \u201cDemocratic support.\u201d Fox News is told Republicans are looking at $100 billion of the $1 trillion to go to state and local governments;\u00a0$70 billion of that will go toward helping schools re-open in a safe manner. \u201cThe Senate had led at every step of this process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to rise to the occasion one more time.\u201d TOP REPUBLICANS MEET WITH TRUMP TO NEGOTIATE NEXT CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PACKAGE Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin this week said the administration is \u201cfocused on starting with another trillion dollars.\u201d \u201cWe think that will make a big impact,\u201d Mnuchin said Monday, while noting that \u201cthe focus is kids and jobs,\u201d and that the goal is to have the package in place by the end of this month. Mnuchin also said lawmakers are aiming to pass the new legislation before the end of July, when the current \u201cenhanced unemployment insurance\u201d expires. The administration also supported liability protections, with Mnuchin saying this week that they \u201cwant to make sure that frivolous lawsuits don\u2019t prevent schools, universities and businesses from reopening.\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., also supported that protection, saying businesses \u201cshould not have an attack from any lawsuits\u201d as they try to reopen. President Trump is continuing to push for a cut in the payroll tax \u2013\u00a0levies that companies pay on behalf of their employees to\u00a0fund Social Security and other benefits \u2013 as part of\u00a0the package. Many Republicans are reluctant to approve such a reduction, though, over deficit concerns. However, advocates in the administration believe the payroll tax would jolt the economy quickly. \u201cThat will be in there,\u201d one senior source close to the talks said of the payroll tax, characterizing it as the president\u2019s \u201cnumber one ask.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram and Ronn Blitzer\u00a0contributed to this report.

        "text": "Games\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin makes remarks at White House coronavirus task force briefing. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Friday urged eligible individuals who have yet to receive their coronavirus stimulus payment to visit the IRS website to upload banking information so that they can get the relief \u201cfast.\u201d \u201cPlease visit IRS.GOV If you have not received your direct payment to upload your bank info so you can get it FAST. #getmypayment #irs #directdeposit #caresact,\u201d Mnuchin tweeted Friday morning. CORONAVIRUS CHECKS ARE ON THEIR WAY: HERE'S HOW IT WORKS \u201cThank you to the 85mm people that have visited IRS.gov and the 4mm that have uploaded new bank info. If you don\u2019t have your payment PLEASE go to IRS.Gov #getmypayment,\u201d he added. Mnuchin\u2019s tweets come after the Treasury Department acknowledged that there have been \u201cglitches\u201d in sending payments to Americans who qualified for the relief via direct deposit. A Treasury Department official told Fox News Thursday that the agency was actively looking into payments that have yet to be received by those qualifying Americans. The official noted that many who have yet to receive the direct deposit had used H&R Block and Turbo Tax to file their taxes in the past and used the refund anticipation loan programs with the companies. That's a\u00a0service where taxpayers can pay the company a small fee in order to receive their tax refund immediately, versus getting it a week or two after filing. The official\u00a0said\u00a0the issue is that those\u00a0fast tracked refunds are put on debit cards, which means the IRS doesn\u2019t have the filers' direct deposit information. The Treasury Department\u2019s acknowledgment of the glitches come after The Washington Post first reported that the coronavirus relief checks have yet to hit several million people\u2019s bank accounts, despite the agency\u2019s promise last week that the majority of individuals would receive their payments by the end of the day on April 15. The Post reported that millions of these individuals used popular tax filing services in the past, and thus, the IRS did not have their direct deposit information on file. But in a statement to Fox News on Friday, a spokesperson for H&R Block said that the IRS does have bank account information for all of their clients who received tax refunds electronically, and said they are determining when and how stimulus payments are distributed. \"They have created confusion by not always using clients\u2019 final destination bank account information for stimulus payments,\" H&R Block said in a statement. \"We share our clients\u2019 frustration that many of them have not yet received these much-needed payments due to IRS decisions, and we are actively working with the IRS to get stimulus payments sent directly to client account.\" Meanwhile, the IRS on Wednesday launched an online tool, the \u201cGet My Payment\u201d app, to allow taxpayers to give the agency their direct deposit information to help speed up the coronavirus relief payments to Americans. The majority of eligible Americans \u2013\u00a0more than 80 million, according to Mnuchin \u2013\u00a0who filed their taxes in 2018 and/or 2019 and received a refund via direct deposit had received their stimulus relief payments by Wednesday. IRS LAUNCHES 'GET MY PAYMENT' APP TO SPEED UP CORONAVIRUS RELIEF Those who do not file taxes are also now able to go to the IRS website and use the \u201cNon-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here\u201d section to enter their bank information in\u00a0order to receive their payment faster than they would via regular mail. Some Americans can expect to receive paper checks in the mail, but that method of delivery could take months. As part of the CARES Act, people who file their taxes as individuals are eligible for payments up to $1,200, and couples who file jointly are eligible for up to $2,400 plus an\u00a0additional $500 per child under the age of 17. The amount decreases for individuals who earn an adjusted gross income of\u00a0more than $75,000 and couples who earn more than $150,000 a year, by $5 for every $100 in income above those marks. This means the payment is less the higher their earnings are, with it being reduced to zero for individuals\u00a0who make $99,000 or more and couples who make $198,000 or more. People who file as heads of household\u00a0are eligible for payments of up to $1,200 plus $500 per child under 17. That amount is reduced for people who earn an adjusted gross income of more than $112,000 a year. The extent to which it is decreased depends on how many children they have. Payment amounts may also be offset by any past due child support payments that have been reported to the Treasury Department. The payments\u00a0do not count as taxable income. Similarly, they do not count for determining eligibility for federal programs like Supplemental Security Income.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that Americans can start to see stimulus checks hit their bank accounts \"as soon as this weekend,\" after President Biden signs\u00a0the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill Friday.\u00a0 Single filers making under $75,000 are slated to receive\u00a0$1,400, as will\u00a0heads of households earning up to $112,500. Couples who filed jointly and make under $150,000 can expect to see $2800 deposited into their account. Taxpayers will also receive $1400 for each dependent. Around 89 percent of American filers will receive a payment, the American Tax Foundation estimates.\u00a0 Those payments phase out and decrease to $0 for single filers who make $80,000 or more, for heads of household who make $120,000 or more and for couples who make $160,000 or more.\u00a0 BIDEN SIGNS $1.9T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL IN FIRST MAJOR LEGISLATIVE WIN \"People can expect to start seeing direct deposits hit their bank accounts as early as this weekend,\" Psaki said.\u00a0 She added that the White House would hold a celebration of the signing of the American Rescue Plan on Friday. She said the invite list had not been finalized but would include leadership from Congress. She said the event would be \u2018bicameral\u2019 but not \u2018bipartisan.\u2019 No Republicans in the House or Senate voted for the bill. This will be the third round of stimulus payments. The CARES Act offered most Americans $1200 and the Omnibus COVID relief deal in December paid out $600.\u00a0 Biden had promised $2,000 checks would be imminent while campaigning in Georgia for Sens. Raphael Warnock and John Ossoff in January.\u00a0 BIDEN'S CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL INCLUDES $60B IN SURPRISE TAX HIKES \"Their election will put an end to the block in Washington on that $2,000 stimulus check \u2013 that money will go out the door immediately to help people who are in real trouble,\" Biden told the crowd. Both Democrats won their runoff races, effectively giving the party a majority in the Senate, considering the tiebreaking vote would be cast by Vice President Kamala Harris. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Some Democrats were angered that instead of separate $2000 checks, Biden added the $600 Americans received in December to the $1400 to total $2000.

The Treasury Department is asking the relatives of deceased and incarcerated family members who mistakingly received\u00a0economic stimulus payments intended to help Americans weather the coronavirus pandemic to return the funds\u00a0to the federal government. The IRS updated two notices Wednesday, issuing clarifications\u00a0that nonresident aliens, deceased persons and\u00a0incarcerated individuals are not eligible for economic relief. \"Deceased and incarcerated individuals do not qualify to receive Economic Impact Payments. See FAQ #41 to learn how to return an inadvertent payment,\" a Treasury Department tweet said. Congress approved a $2.2 trillion relief package in March that provided Americans with one-time payments of up to $1,200 per adult and $500 per child as many Americans face\u00a0financial hardships brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Most of the funds hit bank accounts in April, while others were sent paper checks. A number of deceased people and foreign workers have received payments, which were distributed based on a person's 2018 or 2019 tax returns.\u00a0The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation told Fox News that at least one inmate also received stimulus funds. \"The inmate is a veteran, receives a pension, and files a tax return, which is why we believe he received the payment,\" agency spokeswoman Dana Simas said. Simas said directions were given to each institution in the California prison system to return relief payments mailed\u00a0to inmates. It was unclear whether there will\u00a0be any punitive repercussions if the funds are not returned. An IRS spokesman declined to comment to Fox News on how widespread the mishaps are. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Return instructions vary based on the type of payment issued. For direct deposits, the agency is asking that people submit a money order or personal check to the specified IRS location. Checks should be made payable to \u201cU.S. Treasury\u201d and \"2020EIP\" should be written on them, as well as the taxpayer identification number (Social Security number\u00a0or individual taxpayer identification number) of the recipient of the check. An explanation of why the money is being returned should also be included.

        "text": "Games\nRep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, argues Republicans are not united on spending trillions of dollars on another coronavirus stimulus especially if it involves concessions to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. White House officials and Democratic leaders ended a week of negotiations\u00a0without a deal on the next coronavirus aid package, or even a clear path forward, amid growing concerns that talks may collapse altogether. \u201cWe\u2019re still a considerable amount apart,\u201d\u00a0White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said Thursday after meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. The clock is ticking for both parties to meet their\u00a0self-imposed Friday deadline. If they miss it, Meadows\u00a0has suggested there's \"no sense\" in continuing discussion. MCCONNELL OPENS DOOR TO EXTENDING $600 UNEMPLOYMENT BOOST \"I've become extremely doubtful that we\u2019ll be able to make a deal if it goes well beyond Friday,\" said Meadows, a founding member and former chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who joined the White House this year. The impasse in negotiations puts at risk potentially trillions\u00a0of dollars in aid for families, businesses and the U.S. economy, including a fresh round of $1,200 stimulus checks, extra unemployment aid for millions of\u00a0out-of-work Americans, $100 billion to help reopen schools and relief for cash-strapped state and local governments. \"Without more stimulus, the bottom could\u00a0fall out from the American economy,\" said Josh\u00a0Lipsky, director of programs and policy at the Atlantic Council. \"Millions of unemployed citizens, renters across the country, small business owners, and every state government are asking for help in a time of crisis. We can worry about the price tag later. When your house is on fire, you don\u2019t ask the fireman how much the hose costs.\" Whether to extend the supplemental $600 a week in jobless aid has proven to be a key sticking point in negotiations.\u00a0Democrats have maintained the sweetened benefits need to be extended through the end of the year, while Republicans have argued that it disincentivizes Americans from returning to jobs that pay less, a notion economists have disputed. GOP lawmakers have proposed a\u00a0$200-a-week replacement instead. TRUMP THREATENS TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION IF DEAL ON CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILL NOT REACHED SOON When the $600-a-week federal benefit expired last\u00a0Friday, the typical unemployment check returned to an average of\u00a0$330\u00a0per week, a significant benefit cut for individuals collecting the aid. More than 30 million Americans, or roughly one in five workers, are\u00a0receiving\u00a0unemployment benefits, according to Labor Department\u00a0data. The end of the\u00a0$600 benefit\u00a0is draining\u00a0about\u00a0$15 billion per week from the economy, according to one estimate from the\u00a0Century Foundation, raising fears of a \"fiscal cliff\" that will hurt both\u00a0individual households and the economy's recovery. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's GDP, the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the country. A separate study by the Economic Policy Institute found that expanding jobless aid boosted personal income by $842 billion in May; extending the heightened benefits through mid-2021, the nonprofit said, would provide an average quarterly boon to GDP of 3.7 percent. NEARLY HALF OF US JOBS LOST TO CORONAVIRUS COULD BE GONE PERMANENTLY, POLL FINDS \"Every day Congress delays raises the chance of a double-dip recession,\" Lipsky said. For the past 20\u00a0weeks, jobless claims have continuously topped 1 million;\u00a0before the pandemic, the record high was\u00a0695,000 set in 1982. The Labor Department's July jobs report released on Friday showed that\u00a0employers added 1.8 million jobs in July, sending the unemployment rate down to 10.2%. While it marked\u00a0the third consecutive month of job growth in the millions,\u00a0the economy has so far\u00a0added back less than half --\u00a0about 42 percent -- of the 22 million jobs it lost during the pandemic. There are roughly\u00a010.6 million more out-of-work Americans than in February. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned during congressional testimony in June that recent economic improvements could be jeopardized if Congress turned off the federal support for workers and businesses. Both parties are under growing pressure to reach a deal after the sweetened unemployment and several other\u00a0CARES Act\u00a0provisions ended, dealing a major financial blow to the millions of Americans who lost their\u00a0jobs\u00a0during the\u00a0pandemic. President Trump has threatened to act unilaterally,\u00a0bypassing Congress\u00a0if they're unable to strike a deal. In a tweet, the president said he was considering executive orders to continue expanded unemployment benefits, reinstate an eviction moratorium, cut payroll taxes and continue a suspension of student loan repayments.

        "text": "Games\nDems and GOP set to clash over $2,000 coronavirus relief payments; Reaction and analysis on 'The Five.' President Trump\u2019s last-minute about-face on the size of\u00a0stimulus checks\u00a0for most Americans to help deal with the economic harm caused by the coronavirus pandemic has turned Washington upside down only days before a new Congress is sworn in.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s negotiators had agreed to $600 per person in stimulus checks and had gotten that measure through both the Democratic-controlled House and the Republican-controlled Senate before Christmas. The bill the payments were wrapped into was a typically flawed mixture of needed spending and slabs of Jimmy Dean-sized pork.\u00a0 But Trump\u2019s White House had itself requested much of the pork \u2014 including the foreign aid he\u2019s now railing against \u2014 and never called for $2,000 per person checks until the bill had passed both houses of Congress. MCCONNELL BLOCKS QUICK VOTE ON $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS, SAYS SENATE TO BRING TRUMP REQUESTS 'INTO FOCUS' But now suddenly the president says it\u2019s time to add $350 billion to the deficit and is teaming up with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to fight for the extra spending. Politically, the president\u2019s move has created a nightmare for his fellow Republicans. Trump tweeted Tuesday: \"Unless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH!\" The president may think he is teaching Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and other Republicans a lesson for not supporting him enough in challenging the November election results. But Trump is really damaging the chances that Republicans can hold onto two U.S. Senate seats in Georgia in Tuesday\u2019s runoff elections. If Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock win those two seats, the Senate will be equally divided between Democrats and Republicans, with 50 votes each. As vice president, Kamala Harris will cast a tie-breaking vote to give Democrats the narrowest of majorities. If Democrats capture control of the Senate, you can bet they will endlessly investigate Trump. Georgia Republican Sens. David Perdue (running against Ossoff) and Kelly Loeffler (running against Warnock) now say they back ballooning the deficit with the $2,000 checks to most Americans \u2014 but just a week ago they opposed such a move. Three out of four House Republicans voted against the $2,000 checks on Monday. But enough Republicans joined with all but two House Democrats and two independents to approve the boost in payments, enabling it to pass on a 275-to-134 vote. The measure needed\u00a0272 votes to pass under suspension of House rules. \u00a0 130 HOUSE REPUBLICANS, 2 DEMOCRATS VOTE AGAINST $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS With Republicans split on whether to support or oppose the $2,000 payments, the GOP now appears divided and confused just days before the Georgia runoffs, when it should be united and principled to win the crucial elections. Senate Majority Leader McConnell has responded to this mess by buying time. In addition to his $2,000 check proposal, Trump has made additional demands on Congress. McConnell says Trump's demands regarding $2,000 checks, repealing liability protections enjoyed by social media platforms, and investigating voter fraud are \"linked together\" and the Senate will start to debate them this week. If all those Trump ideas are packaged into one bill, Democrats will complain that the final product is a poison pill they can\u2019t swallow. And if this bill combining three separate issues is passed in the Senate, there\u2019s no way a compromise with the House\u2019s version could be agreed to before this Congress turns into a pumpkin on Sunday.\u00a0At that point, members of the new Congress elected in November take office and will have to start from scratch to come up with new legislation. \u00a0 The irony is that most Republicans and many Democrats know that tossing free money out of a helicopter is a terrible way to help the economy or even individual families.\u00a0 Stephen Moore, an economist who helped design President Trump\u2019s tax cuts, says: \"Are Republicans going to be the party that give us a backdoor Universal Basic Income, i.e. free money for every American? That\u2019s an idea that was laughed off the stage, literally, in the Democratic debates earlier this year.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Moore argues that the best way to help people is to prudently allow the economy in lockdown states to reopen and get people back to work. On the left, both economist\u00a0Larry Summers, a former top aide to President Obama, and many progressive policy experts oppose the $2,000 payments, saying it would be better to spend a smaller amount of money on more targeted aid that didn\u2019t go to a lot of families who don\u2019t need it.\u00a0 But common sense is in short supply in Washington right now. The entire town is gripped by a political fever in which both sides are desperate to avoid bad political optics before the crucial Georgia elections.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The late President Calvin Coolidge was a man of few words but those he uttered were often profound. He once observed: \"It is much more important to kill bad bills than to pass good ones.\" Here\u2019s hoping that Mitch McConnell can find a way to keep the Frankenstein monster of $2,000 checks constructed by the odd couple of Bernie Sanders and President Trump from springing to life. What Congress has already passed is bad enough without making it worse. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM JOHN FUND John Fund is a columnist for National Review magazine.

        "text": "Games\nRep. Blaine Luetkemeyer, R-Mo., analyzes the plan on \u2018Fox &amp; Friends First.\u2019 The Democratic Party's official Twitter account has sparked backlash Saturday after tweeting that President Biden will \"build on the $600 down payment provided by Congress last year, sending an additional $1,400 to households across America, totaling direct payments to $2,000 per person.\" Critics of the tweet claim it contradicts\u00a0the promise made by Biden that\u00a0a separate, $2,000 stimulus check would \"go out the door immediately\u00a0to help people who are in real trouble\" if Georgia voters cast their ballots for the newly-elected Democratic Sens.\u00a0Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock during the state\u00a0runoff elections earlier this month.\u00a0 SANDERS DISMISSES BIDEN 'UNITY' PLEDGE TO PUSH COVID RELIEF BILL Some replied directly to the tweet, including one user who accused the party and Biden of \"gaslighting the very people who trusted & voted for you\" while another chimed in, writing \"Good luck in the midterms with this incredible strategy.\" Others expressed their anger for the alleged pivot using #BidenLied, including podcast host Ryan Knight. \"The most pathetic part about all of this is that even Donald Trump gave us $1800 ($1200 + $600) in relief checks last year and@JoeBiden is trying to get away with breaking his promise of $2000 checks and only giving us $1400 checks,\" Knight wrote.\u00a0\"Biden is giving us less than Trump.\" BIDEN ADVISER SHRUGS OFF FILIBUSTER, RECONCILIATION CONCERNS ABOUT STIMULUS: AMERICANS 'COULDN'T CARE LESS' According to Biden's $1.9 trillion\u00a0'American Rescue Plan' unveiled last week, individuals eligible for the\u00a0one-time $1400 stimulus check will include\u00a0adult dependents who were previously excluded from receiving the money, including college students and individuals with disabilities. It will also include\u00a0households with mixed immigration statuses that were left out of the original $1,200 stimulus payment\u00a0approved under the CARES Act in March for not having Social Security numbers. The plan also offers\u00a0$400 per week in supplemental unemployment aid, a temporary, fully refundable tax credit expansion, rental assistance, an eviction moratorium through September 2021, a minimum wage increase, emergency paid leave, small business assistance, $350 billion in aid for local and state governments, help for the hungry, and $20 billion in funding for vaccine distribution.\u00a0 NEW REPUBLICAN STIMULUS PROPOSAL WOULD COST $600B, INCLUDE MORE STIMULUS CHECKS: WHAT TO KNOW Democratic leadership said over the weekend that they would begin pushing to approve\u00a0the plan as soon as this upcoming week. \"The Senate, as early as next week, will begin the process of considering a very strong COVID relief bill,\" Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said.\u00a0\"We need recovery and rescue quickly. Everywhere you look alarm bells are ringing.\"\u00a0 However, while many Republican lawmakers believe that another relief package is needed to boost the economy's recovery, some have criticized the size of Biden's proposal as too expensive.\u00a0 Instead, a group of Republicans have proposed a $600 billion proposal, which would include\u00a0$160 billion toward vaccines, personal protective equipment, support for health care providers,\u00a0$4 billion for behavioral health and substance abuse services, and\u00a0$20 billion for schools, as well as an extension in enhanced federal unemployment benefits and \"additional resources\" for the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program to help small businesses and their employees. \u00a0The group\u00a0said they would release additional details on Monday.\u00a0 CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The Biden's administration proposal will likely fail to meet\u00a0the 60-vote threshold needed to pass the Senate\u00a0without Democrats relying on budget reconciliation. The Biden administration has not ruled out the possibility of using reconciliation to pass the measure, with\u00a0White House press secretary Jen Psaki telling reporters\u00a0last week\u00a0that \"we are not going to take any tools off the table.\"\u00a0 COVID-19 has infected\u00a0over 26 million Americans and killed over 441,000 Americans since March, according to Johns Hopkins University. Lockdown measures adopted across the country to curb the spread of the virus have cost millions of Americans their jobs.

        "text": "Games\nRepublican Sen. John Barrasso says the bill can't be 'handout heaven' like what was passed by House Democrats. The focus of the next coronavirus stimulus bill \u201chas to be\u00a0getting people back to work\u201d and getting \u201cpaychecks back into their\u00a0pockets,\u201d\u00a0Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said on Sunday.  Barrasso made the comments one week before Congress is scheduled to return to Washington to start hammering out the next stimulus bill. The bipartisan talks will take place as the extra $600 in weekly\u00a0unemployment benefits is set to\u00a0expire at the end of the month. \u201cThere\u2019s a consensus\u00a0we need to do another bill,\u00a0that\u2019ll be in the next couple of\u00a0weeks,\u201d Barrasso said in an exclusive interview on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d He then explained what he thinks should be included in the \u201cPhase 4\u201d coronavirus stimulus bill.  \u201cIt has to focus on\u00a0getting people back to work and\u00a0children back in school,\u201d he said, adding that it must also \u201cfocus on\u00a0saving lives.\u201d \u201cTo me, that\u00a0means more testing, better\u00a0treatment and then, of course, a\u00a0vaccine,\u201d Barrasso, who is a doctor, explained.  CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE \u201cFinally, we need to\u00a0provide the liability insurance\u00a0for our healthcare workers, for\u00a0our mom and pop small\u00a0businesses and for our schools\u00a0so they can all open in a good\u00a0way,\u201d he continued.  Barrasso then brought up the fact that the Democratic-controlled House approved a $3 trillion proposal in May, which Senate Republicans deemed dead on arrival. He said the Democrat\u2019s proposal depicts House Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u201cliving\u00a0in handout heaven.\u201d  Pelosi has said priorities for the next round of coronavirus legislation include money to state and local governments, more\u00a0coronavirus testing, and more\u00a0direct payments for Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s direct checks to illegal\u00a0immigrants, it\u2019s bailouts to big city and\u00a0state pension plans that are run\u00a0by Democrats,\u201d Barrasso said on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do that.\u201d If legislation comes to fruition, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said it would pass this month before lawmakers leave for recess in August. President Trump told Fox Business\u00a0he supports another round of stimulus checks, which could be even larger than $1,200. However, not all Republicans are on the same page. The recent record-breaking June jobs report, which showed the creation of 4.8 million nonfarm payroll positions last month, has caused some lawmakers \u2013 like Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy \u2013 to question the need for more direct payments. Barrasso acknowledged on Sunday that the question is if the next round of stimulus should \u201cinclude additional relief checks\u00a0for people who have still not\u00a0been able to get back to work,\u00a0certainly in hard-hit industries,\u00a0whether it\u2019s the service\u00a0industry, the hospitality\u00a0industry.\u201d  \u201cWe did that\u00a0once before, but that was people\u00a0up to $95,000, we\u2019re looking at\u00a0a lower number there,\u201d he continued.  Barrasso noted that there is an \u201curgency to get this done\u201d because of upcoming deadlines as it pertains to the enhanced unemployment insurance and the Paycheck Protection Program, which he said \u201chas been so successful\u201d and has \u201chelped keep about\u00a050 million people on a payroll.\u201d Host Maria Bartiromo noted that Congress has another scheduled recess starting on August 8 and asked Barrasso, \u201cShould I assume we will have\u00a0another stimulus package in that\u00a0three week period?\u201d \u201cThere is [a] general agreement\u00a0we need to work to that end and\u00a0we need to deal with the issues\u00a0affecting our nation,\u201d he said in response. \u201cThere are still people who can\u2019t\u00a0go back to work through no fault\u00a0of their own because of the\u00a0disease, because of maybe\u00a0medical conditions.\u201d  \u201cWe need to make sure that they\u00a0are cared for, but we cannot\u00a0continue to pay people more to\u00a0sit at home than to go to work\u00a0and we have so many help wanted\u00a0signs around Wyoming and the\u00a0country,\u201d he continued.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cWe need to do all we\u00a0can to get people back to work\u00a0and help them earn that paycheck,\u201d Barrasso stressed.

        "text": "Games\nFormer White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus speaks out against Biden executive order agenda. President Biden on Friday made the case for Congress to quickly pass\u00a0his\u00a0nearly $2 trillion coronavirus\u00a0relief package even if it means\u00a0abandoning Republican support, warning of an economy that's still in the grips of the pandemic. \"It is very clear our economy is still in trouble,\" Biden said during remarks at the White House. \"I know some in Congress think we\u2019ve already done enough to deal with the crisis in the country. Others think that things are getting better and we can afford to sit back and either do little or do nothing at all. That\u2019s not what I see. I see enormous pain in this country. A lot of folks out of work. A lot of folks going hungry.\" Biden's comments came as the Labor Department reported that employment rose by just 49,000 last month,\u00a0a lackluster start to the new year as COVID-19 and restrictions implemented to curb its spread continued to weigh on businesses.\u00a0The unemployment rate edged down to 6.3%.\u00a0 SENATE SIGNALS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR MORE TARGETED $1,400 STIMULUS CHECKS In total, the U.S. has recovered roughly half of the 22 million jobs lost during the first two months of the pandemic. There are still about 9.9\u00a0million more Americans out of work than there were in February before the crisis began, the report shows. The broader economic recovery has also sputtered in recent months:\u00a0Unemployment claims, a proxy for layoffs, have remained at about four-times their pre-crisis level. Consumer spending fell as Americans stayed home\u00a0\u2014 and those who ventured out had limited options. GDP, the broadest measure of goods and services, grew just 1% in the final three months of the year, compared with an increase of 7.48% between the second and third quarters. Democrats are moving to fast-track\u00a0Biden's pandemic relief plan, with the Senate approving\u00a0a budget resolution early Friday morning that will allow them to pass the measure\u00a0without any Republican buy-ins using a procedural tool known as \"reconciliation.\"\u00a0\u00a0 House committee chairs\u00a0and Democratic leaders met with Biden\u00a0at the White House before his address to discuss strategy. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said it was her goal to have a bill approved and send it to the Senate within two weeks as lawmakers look to enact the proposal before the next unemployment cliff on March 14. WHO WILL RECEIVE A THIRD STIMULUS CHECK? WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR The legislation is expected to allocate\u00a0$160 billion for vaccine distribution, boost expanded unemployment benefits to\u00a0$400 a week through September and include\u00a0a third stimulus check worth $1,400. It will add to the nation's already-ballooning deficit, which hit a record $3.1 trillion in fiscal year 2020, not including the $900 billion relief package passed in December. Biden, who campaigned on uniting the country and ending partisan bickering, defended Democrats'\u00a0decision to ram through the relief bill without GOP support, even after a group of 10 Republicans counteroffered the White House\u00a0with a $600 billion proposal earlier this week.\u00a0 \"If I have to choose between getting help right now to Americans who are hurting so badly and getting bogged down in a lengthy negotiation or compromising on a bill that\u2019s up to the crisis, that\u2019s an easy choice,\" Biden said during the brief 15-minute speech, after which he did not take reporters' questions. \"I\u2019m going to help the American people who are hurting now. What Republicans have proposed is either to do nothing or not enough.\" STIMULUS CHECKS SHOULD TARGET POORER AMERICANS, HARVARD RESEARCHERS SAY Still, the president has indicated that he's willing to acquiesce to Republicans and some moderate Democrats regarding eligibility for the direct cash payments.\u00a0It's unclear what threshold his administration would start phasing out the money. Under previous relief packages, Americans earning less than $75,000 received the fully promised payment.\u00a0 But Biden insisted the size of the check \u2014 $1,400\u00a0\u2014 won't change. \"I\u2019m not cutting the size of the checks,\" he\u00a0said Friday. \"They\u2019re going to be $1,400, period.

        "text": "Games\nChad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said\u00a0Tuesday that he could support\u00a0extending the extra $600-a-week unemployment benefit\u00a0in the next coronavirus relief package -- so long as President Trump backs the measure. Democratic leaders and White House officials are trying to finalize another round of emergency aid this week and hold a vote in Congress next week. If the negotiators, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, cut\u00a0a deal that includes $600 jobless aid, McConnell said he would support it. TRUMP THREATENS TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION IF DEAL ON CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILL NOT REACHED SOON \"Wherever this thing settles between the president of the United States and his team that has to sign it into law, and the Democrats, a not-insignificant-minority in the Senate and majority in the House, is something I'm prepared to support,\" McConnell told reporters during his weekly press conference. \"Even if I have some problems with certain parts of it.\" Both parties are under growing pressure to reach a deal days after several\u00a0CARES Act\u00a0provisions, including an eviction moratorium and supplement unemployment aid,\u00a0expired, dealing a major financial blow to the millions of Americans who lost their\u00a0jobs\u00a0during the\u00a0pandemic. One major point of contention during negotiations has been whether or not to continue boosting unemployment benefits by $600 a week. Democrats have maintained the sweetened benefits need to be extended through the end of the year and have made it a key sticking point; Republicans have argued that it disincentivizes Americans from returning to their jobs, and have instead proposed a $200-a-week replacement. CALCULATE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'D RECEIVE FROM THE SECOND STIMULUS CHECK HERE Adding to the urgency is the Labor Department's July jobs report, slated to be released Friday. The unemployment figures will shed light on whether\u00a0a fresh round of business closures amid a spike in COVID-19 cases is dampening the nation's economic and jobs market recovery. Republicans arrived at the negotiating table hobbled by party infighting, with some conservatives voicing concern about the nation's ballooning deficit, which is expected to hit $3.7 trillion in 2020, a record high, according to the Congressional Budget Office. McConnell noted that many Republicans would likely not vote for the final stimulus legislation if it restores the unemployment aid.

Georgia\u2019s GOP incumbent senators fighting to keep their seats in the special runoff find themselves in a tough position after President Trump\u2019s eleventh-hour demands for Congress to approve $2,000 stimulus check payments in coronavirus aid. Sen. Kelley Loeffler, in a tight race against Democratic candidate, Rev. Raphael Warnock, said she would consider voting for the new figure, which Democrats originally pushed in the stimulus package if it diverted funds away from \"wasteful spending.\"\u00a0 \"I'll certainly look at supporting it if it repurposes wasteful spending toward that,\" she said, during a campaign event Wednesday, reported The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In a Tuesday evening address from the White House, Trump condemned the latest coronavirus relief package passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. He\u00a0called on Congress to send him a \"suitable\" bill with stimulus checks that more than double the $600 figure allotted by Congress earlier this week.\u00a0\u00a0 Following the president\u2019s remarks Tuesday night, Democrats jumped at the opportunity to demand increased stimulus checks.\u00a0Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi tweeted, \"Republicans repeatedly refused to say what amount the President wanted for direct checks. At last, the President has agreed to $2,000.\" \"Mr. President, sign the bill to keep government open! Urge McConnell and McCarthy to agree with the Democratic unanimous consent request for $2,000 direct payments,\" she added in a tweet Wednesday. \"This can be done by noon on Christmas Eve!\" TRUMP PUTS GOP ON ITS HEELS WITH 11TH-HOUR STIMULUS DEMANDS, THROWS WRENCH INTO GEORGIA SENATE RACE Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said she and fellow \"squad\" member Rep. Rashida Talib, D-Mich., already had co-written an amendment to the $900 billion relief package to increase funding directed for stimulus checks. \"I\u2019m in. Whaddya say, Mitch?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said late Tuesday night. \"Let\u2019s not get bogged down with ideological offsets and unrelated items and just DO THIS! The American people deserve it.\" Loeffler and her GOP colleague in the other \"Peach State\" runoff, Sen. David Perdue,\u00a0voted in favor of the bill Monday,\u00a0but their Democratic challengers Warnock and Jon Ossoff respectively called on both to back Trump\u2019s calls for increased stimulus checks. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"As I\u2019ve said from the start, the Senate should have acted on this months ago and support for Georgians should have been far greater,\" Warnock said Wednesday. \"Donald Trump is right, Congress should swiftly increase direct payments to $2,000.\" Trump has not said whether or not he will attempt to veto the latest coronavirus relief package, though Congress passed the measure with veto-proof bipartisan support. \u00a0It is unclear at this time how congressional Republicans will vote on the amendment to the coronavirus relief bill.

White House\u00a0press secretary Jen Psaki said President Biden is \"open to engaging\" with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress ahead of his meeting with GOP senators Monday in the Oval Office to discuss a potential compromise on a coronavirus relief plan, adding that, in his view, the \"risk\" would be moving forward on a package that is \"not big enough\" to address the needs of Americans amid the pandemic.\u00a0 The president invited a group of 10 Republican senators, led by Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, to the White House Monday to discuss a potential compromise on a coronavirus relief plan that could gain bipartisan support to pass the Senate.\u00a0 GOP SENATORS TO MEET WITH BIDEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE TO DISCUSS CORONAVIRUS RELIEF The group\u00a0also includes Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska; Bill Cassidy of Louisiana; Mitt Romney of Utah; Rob Portman of Ohio; Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia; Todd Young of Indiana; Jerry Moran of Kansas; Mike Rounds of South Dakota; and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. The Republicans announced a $600 billion plan Sunday, which includes $1,000 per person stimulus checks and $300 per week in boosted unemployment benefits through June 30.\u00a0 The package, though, is significantly smaller than that of Biden's American Rescue Plan, which would cost a whopping $1.9 trillion.\u00a0 Psaki, on Monday, said Biden has \"been clear since long before he came into office that he is open to engaging with both Democrats and Republicans in Congress,\" and called Monday's meeting with GOP senators an \"opportunity\" for an \"exchange of ideas.\"\u00a0 \"I think the president believes we can, and that there is historic evidence, that it is possible to take a number of paths, including through reconciliation and for the vote to be bipartisan,\" Psaki said, adding that Biden is open to hearing Republican \"concerns and ideas,\" and is \"always open to making this package stronger.\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Monday, Feb. 1, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) ((AP Photo/Evan Vucci)) Psaki added that the meeting Monday is an \"effort to engage on a bipartisan basis and that is why he invited them to the White House today.\"\u00a0 \"But his view is that the size of the package needs to be commensurate to the dual crises we are facing,\" Psaki said, adding that the president \"clearly\" thinks the White House\u00a0package \"needs to be closer to what he proposed.\" \"Reopning schools, getting shots in the arms of Americans, ensuring people have food to eat, those are not Democratic issues,\" Psaki said. \"He wants to have the conversation with Republicans...He welcomes the opportunity to work with members.\"\u00a0 BIDEN SUGGESTS HE WOULD ALLOW COVID-19 RELIEF BILL TO MOVE UNDER 'RECONCILIATION' WITH GOP SUPPORT Psaki also assured that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have been directly in touch with the president and members of the senior team at the White House. Psaki called movement on the coronavirus relief package \"incredbily urgent,\" but did say, however, that there \"is still time to make changes and to continue to have a discussion.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Even if Biden and Republicans do come to a compromise somewhere between their respective proposals,\u00a0it's not clear that plan would be able to round up support from all 50 Senate Democrats, who are pushing for bold and immediate action. Congressional Democrats this week will introduce budget resolutions in each chamber, the first step towards the once-per-fiscal-year parliamentary gambit of budget\u00a0reconciliation. Using that, they can pass a bill with no GOP support, though it may take weeks.\u00a0 Fox News' Tyler Olson, Chad Pergram and Megan Henney contributed to this report.\u00a0 Brooke Singman is a political correspondent and reporter for Fox News Digital, Fox News Channel and FOX Business.

Scammers are continuing to use the coronavirus pandemic as cover for schemes to steal personal information and money, the IRS has warned. According to a statement, the IRS Criminal Investigation\u00a0unit has seen \u201ca tremendous increase in phishing schemes utilizing emails, letters, texts and links.\u201d The schemes typically use keywords such as \"Corona Virus,\" \"COVID-19,\" and \"Stimulus\u201d in phishing email subject lines. \u201cThese schemes are blasted to large numbers of people,\u201d the IRS added. YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD AFTER THIS SHOCKING STUDY A scammer might try to get you to pay a fee to get your stimulus payment. Other tactics they may also use include tricking people into giving them their\u00a0Social Security number, bank account\u00a0or government benefits debit card account number. The IRS will never contact you by phone, email, text message, or social media with information about your stimulus payment. Nor will it\u00a0ask you for your Social Security number, bank account, or government benefits debit card account number. Cybersecurity firm Check Point software said this week that it is seeing a stimulus payment scam that purports to come from the World Health Organization\u00a0with the subject line \u201cStimulus Package for you\u201d promising large sums of money. New IRS scams are popping up as well. During May, more than\u00a01,200 new Stimulus/Relief package related websites were registered, 3 percent\u00a0(37) of them were found to be malicious and another 2.5 percent\u00a0(30) were\u00a0found to be suspicious, Check Point said. NORTH KOREA CONDUCTING MASSIVE CYBER THREATS AGAINST US, OTHER COUNTRIES, REPORTS SAY Secret Service Assistant Director Michael D\u2019Ambrosio testified this week that\u00a0coronavirus-related fraud could lead to $30 billion in federal relief funds being stolen by criminals. \u201cWe are entering the \u2018Post COVID Era\u2019 relative to cybersecurity, meaning the attack volume and vectors are shifting as the attackers are learning new ways to gain malicious access to the public's personal information or finances,\u201d Mark Ostrowski, Head of Engineering, Check Point Office of the CTO, told Fox News. This follows a report from Check Point in April, where it said new website domain registrations soared in the wake of the $2.2 trillion stimulus package, with nearly 30 percent found to be suspicious out of the 2,000 or so new domains registered in March. During the week leading up to April 16, Google saw more than 18 million daily malware and phishing emails related to COVID-19 scams on top of the 240 million daily spam messages it sees related to the pandemic. SCAMS ARE WIDE-RANGING The IRS pointed to other COVID-19 scams it is\u00a0seeing, including fake at-home test kits, fake cures, vaccines, pills and advice on unproven treatments for COVID-19. Another variety tries to sell medical supplies through fake shops, websites, social media accounts and email addresses. In these cases, unsuspecting buyers will never receive the product after paying for it. Other COVID-19-related scams include fake charities to solicit donations and bogus \u201copportunities\u201d to invest early in companies working on a vaccine for the disease, the IRS added.

The $2.2 trillion bill\u00a0includes language that allows some illegal immigrants -- who are \u201cengaged in essential critical infrastructure labor or services in the United States\u201d --\u00a0 to be placed into \u201ca period of deferred action\u201d and authorized to work if they meet certain conditions. MCCONNELL ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF DEAL: 'WE ARE VERY, VERY FAR APART'\u00a0 It also grants protections to those employers who hire those undocumented immigrants, ordering that \u201cthe hiring, employment or continued employment\u201d of the defined group is not in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That lasts until 90 days after the public health emergency is ended. A Democratic description of that part of the bill says that \u201csuch workers are deemed to be in a period of deferred action and to be authorized for employment, and employers are shielded from certain immigration-related violations for employing such workers.\" It\u2019s language that was included in the first House Democratic stimulus bill proposed back in May -- a bill that was ultimately rejected in the Republican-controlled Senate. Also in the legislation\u00a0is language that would allow the a second round of stimulus checks, $1,200 per adults and $500 per dependant, to be extended to those without a social security number -- including those in the country illegally who file taxes via an\u00a0Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). HOUSE DEMOCRATS' NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL ELIMINATES $600M FOR POLICING: 'IT'S SHAMEFUL' The bill also would require the Department of Homeland Security to review the files of those in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody and to prioritize those for release if they are not a threat to national security. It also demands migrants have access to free video calls and access to virtual legal assistance from nonprofits. Those parts of the bill\u00a0were\u00a0criticized by immigration hawks like the Federation for American Immigration Reform.

Even though it has absolutely zero chance of becoming law, I hope voters are paying close attention.\u201d The House was expected to vote on the bill Wednesday evening, but it was later delayed to allow Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin another day to attempt to thrash out a deal.Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

        "text": "Games\nCongress is stuck repeating the same thing over and over again each day; Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill. Senate Republicans reportedly plan to renew the push for a coronavirus stimulus deal with the introduction of a slimmed-down aid package amid a weeks-long\u00a0impasse between the White House and top Democrats. The smaller GOP\u00a0relief bill is expected to include $300 in extra weekly federal unemployment benefits until December 27, another tranche of money for the Paycheck Protection Program and an additional $10 billion for the U.S. Postal Service and liability protections, according to Politico, citing two GOP sources. The proposal would also allocate additional funding for schools and education. WHITE HOUSE, DEMS 'MILES APART' OVER VIRUS AID PACKAGE, PELOSI SAYS The revised measure would\u00a0represent a scaled-back version of the $1 trillion HEALS Act introduced by Republicans at the end of July. But the new proposal\u00a0notably does not include a second $1,200 stimulus check for American families, unlike the HEALS Act. Both parties\u00a0indicated last week\u00a0that an agreement is still out of reach after\u00a0days of no in-person meetings, signaling the stalemate over the next rescue bill could drag into September. One of the biggest points of contention between the parties is the cost of the proposal. Democrats have offered to come down $1 trillion from the roughly $3 trillion HEROES Act, which the House passed in May. But the White House and Republican leaders want to keep the price tag closer to $1 trillion\u00a0amid growing concerns over the nation's ballooning deficit. Democrats are now saying they will only sit down with Republicans if they agree to a $2 trillion price tag. Asked last week\u00a0when she thought she might speak with Republicans again, Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters: \"I don\u2019t know. When they come in with $2 trillion.\" WASHINGTON IMPASSE ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF THREATENS US ECONOMY Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has called the $2 trillion figure a \"non-starter,\" and has urged Democrats to return to the bargaining table and\u00a0compromise on a $1 trillion package. \"My view on negotiations\u00a0is you agree on the things that you can agree on, half legislation that's\u00a0good for the American public, and then come back for another bill,\" Mnuchin told FOX Business last week. Most Senators returned to their home states on August 6 and are not scheduled to return until Labor Day; there have been no signs that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to call back the senators to vote on the legislation. Lawmakers will be given 24 hours notice if they need to return to the Capitol to vote on a deal. During a news conference in Kentucky on Monday, McConnell said he remained hopeful\u00a0the two sides can strike a deal, but did not guarantee the possibility of one. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you with certainty we\u2019re going to reach an agreement,\u201d he said. SECOND STIMULUS CHECK MAY NOT GO OUT UNTIL SEPTEMBER AS RELIEF TALKS DRAG ON House lawmakers recessed at the beginning of August, but are slated\u00a0to return to Washington for a rare Saturday vote on legislation that would provide $25 billion in funding to the cash-poor U.S. Postal Service. President Trump, facing a deadlocked\u00a0Congress, issued\u00a0a series of\u00a0executive actions last week that he said would address the economic fallout from the pandemic. The measures would postpone the collection of payroll taxes for individuals earning less than $104,000 annually through the remainder of the year; partially restore supplemental unemployment benefits at $400 per week (25% of which would come\u00a0from cash-strapped state's budgets), extend student loan relief and discourage evictions. Trump has vowed\u00a0to forgive any taxes that are deferred, but without legislation, those payments will still be required by the delayed due date. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Some of his proposals are expected to\u00a0face legal challenges. The Constitution gives Congress the power of federal spending, meaning that Trump does not have the legal authority to issue executive orders allocating\u00a0how much money should be spent on the pandemic.

The president\u00a0accused Pelosi of pushing for a $2.4 trillion package that would act as a bailout to \u201cpoorly run, high crime, Democrat States.\u201d He said Republicans had made a \u201cgenerous\u201d $1.6 trillion offer, which she rejected. House Democrats instead passed a $2.2 trillion package last week that has no chance of\u00a0 making it through the Republican-held Senate. PELOSI CITES FED'S POWELL IN LATEST PUSH FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF AID Reversing course hours later, after the stock market tanked, Trump pushed for a standalone bill to approve $1,200 stimulus checks and\u00a0telling Pelosi to \u201cmove fast.\u201d Trump also called on Congress to pass piecemeal relief measures for the ailing airline industry and to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program, utilizing unspent CARES Act funds. Pelosi has held steadfast on passing a broader relief package. TRUMP URGES CONGRESS TO PASS MORE CORONAVIRUS AID HOURS AFTER BREAKING OFF NEGOTIATIONS\u00a0 \"It\u2019s hard to see any clear sane path on what he\u2019s doing, but the fact is he saw the political downside of his statement of walking away from the negotiations,\" she told \u201cThe View.\u201d He\u2019s rebounding from a terrible mistake he made yesterday, and the Republicans in Congress are going down the drain with him on that.\" Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke on the phone Wednesday morning to discuss a second bailout for the airline industry. Last week, U.S. airlines began cutting 35,000 jobs following the expiration of a $25 billion bailout fund that was created earlier this year as part of the CARES Act. Under the terms of the agreement, airlines were prohibited from cutting jobs or reducing workers' pay through Sept. 30. \u201cThe secretary inquired about a standalone airlines bill,\"\u00a0Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill tweeted of the speaker\u2019s meeting with Mnuchin. \"The speaker reminded him that Republicans blocked that bill on Friday & asked him to review the DeFazio bill so that they could have an informed conversation.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Last week, Republicans blocked an attempt by Democrats to pass by unanimous consent a standalone airline bill introduced by House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.

The re-election arm of the Senate GOP\u2019s taking aim four Democrats facing challenging re-elections this year in a new ad blitz that criticizes them and their colleagues for voting last year to give coronavirus pandemic stimulus checks to convicted felons. In the digital spots, which were shared first with Fox News on Tuesday, National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) chair Sen. Rick Scott points to convicted Boston Marathon terrorist bomber\u00a0Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as well as Larry Nassar, who was convicted of raping and molesting female gymnasts during his 18-year tenure as team doctor of the United States women's national gymnastics team. \"Guess what they have in common,\" the senator from Florida says to camera in the ad. \"They are criminals who received stimulus checks from your tax dollars. Republicans tried to stop them, but every Senate Democrat voted to give stimulus checks to convicted criminals in jail.\" SENATE GOP RE-ELECTION ARM HAULS IN A RECORD $104M LAST YEAR Scott then emphasizes that \"the terrorist who maimed and killed people at the Boston Marathon, the pervert doctor who molested gymnasts, and thousands of other criminals got checks for $1,400, your money, courtesy of Senate Democrats.\" \"If that doesn\u2019t tick you off, nothing will,\" the NRSC chair argues. Scott\u2019s referring to an amendment put forward by Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana last March, during a very long Senate debate and votes on the sweeping COVID-19 relief passage that passed the Democratic controlled Senate along party lines. The passage of the Democrats\u2019 bill through both houses of Congress was President Biden\u2019s first major legislative victory after taking over in the White House two months earlier. The GOP amendment, which also failed along party lines, would have prevented the $1,400 stimulus checks for going to those incarcerated in federal or state prisons. Democrats at the time said they opposed the Republican amendment because they claimed it would hurt the families of prisoners, making it harder for them to pay their monthly bills. And Democrats pointed out that two previous rounds of stimulus checks \u2013 which were passed by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress and signed into law by then President Donald Trump \u2013 allowed prisoners to receive the payments. 2022 MIDTERMS: WILL A RED WAVE OVERCOME A BLUE WALL? Scott pledges in the ad that \"we\u2019re going throw these Democrats out of office this November. We only need one more seat and we need your help. Donate today.\" GOP Sen. Rick Scott of Florida speaks with Fox News while attending the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual conference in Las Vegas, on Nov. 5, 2021 (Fox News\u00a0) The Senate is currently split 50-50 between the two major parties, but the Democrats have the majority thanks to the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris. That means Republicans need a net gain of just one seat to win back the majority they lost when they were narrowly swept in Georgia\u2019s Jan. 5, 2021 twin Senate runoff elections. The GOP is defending 20 of the 34 seats up for grabs in 2022. That includes five open seats, including Republican retirements in the key battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and North Carolina and the competitive state of Ohio, as well as in Missouri and Alabama. But Republicans see strong opportunities to flip blue seats to red in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and potentially New Hampshire, where first-term Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly, Raphael Warnock, Catherine Cortez Masto, and Maggie Hassan are running for re-election in crucial general election battleground states.

        "text": "Games\nGeorgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler joins 'Fox &amp; Friends' ahead of her runoff election against Democratic candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock. Democratic Georgia\u00a0U.S. Senate candidate Raphael Warnock argued Tuesday that Georgians \"can\u2019t trust\" his Republican opponent, Sen. Kelly Loeffler, to follow through on coronavirus-related relief measures after she signaled her support for larger stimulus checks. Loeffler joined President Trump and a growing number of Republicans who have called for $2,000 stimulus checks after an initial package approved by congressional leaders included a direct payment of just $600 for most families. The Warnock campaign accused Loeffler of adopting a \"new position\" in support of larger checks despite failing to secure additional aid over the last several months. \"Kelly Loeffler made clear her priorities when she sold $3 million of her own stock while downplaying the pandemic, called unemployment relief 'counterproductive,'\u00a0and then waited nearly nine months to take any action on additional relief while Georgians lost their jobs,\" Warnock said in a statement. \"Georgians learned long ago they can't trust Kelly Loeffler to look out for anyone but herself.\" With Georgia\u2019s two U.S. Senate runoff elections just days away, the status of additional economic relief measures has emerged as a critical issue for candidates of both parties. President Trump approved a $900 billion relief package on Sunday, even as he publicly called on lawmakers to increase direct payments to $2,000 from $600. Loeffler and Sen. David Perdue, the other Georgia Republican running for reelection, claimed they secured additional aid for Georgians despite obstruction from congressional Democrats. Perdue is opposed by Democrat Jon Ossoff. Warnock has repeatedly accused Loeffler of prioritizing her own economic interests over those of ordinary Americans during the pandemic. At the same time, the Loeffler campaign has argued that alleged incidents in Warnock\u2019s past, including claims that he obstructed a police investigation into child abuse at a camp he oversaw in 2002 and domestic incident involving his ex-wife earlier this year, should disqualify him from consideration. \"It\u2019s pretty clear Georgians aren\u2019t too concerned about what someone who covered up domestic and child abuse \u2014 and then lied about it \u2014 has to say,\" Loeffler campaign spokesman Stephen Lawson said in a statement. Warnock and Ossoff both support larger direct payments for Americans. Perdue also has expressed support for $2,000 payments after previously opposing a second round of stimulus checks. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP During a floor speech on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the upper chamber would \"begin a process\" to consider Trump\u2019s demand for larger stimulus checks. The Senate blocked a measure from Democrats that called for an immediate vote on $2,000 direct payments. The outcome of Georgia\u2019s runoff elections will determine control of the Senate. The vote is slated for Jan. 5.

John Barrasso, R-Wy., made that the $1,400 checks Americans were set to receive would be going to those not qualified or worthy for them.\u00a0 WASHINGTON POST ISSUES \u2018CORRECTION\u2019 ON 2020 TOM COTTON STORY CLAIMING COVID LAB-LEAK THEORY WAS \u2018DEBUNKED\u2019 \"On March 8, [Cotton] tweeted that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston bomber, would also get benefits and declared, \u2018Get ready for campaign ads,\u2019\" Kessler wrote at the time, quoting Cotton. \"But for all the hype, there\u2019s less to these claims than one might imagine \u2014 particularly because the previous stimulus bills passed last year under GOP control also did not bar payments to prisoners and the small subset of undocumented immigrants referenced by Barrasso.\" ILE - This file photo released April 19, 2013, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted and sentenced to death for carrying out the April 15, 2013 Boston Marathon bombing attack that killed three people and injured more than 260. (FBI via AP, File) (FBI via AP, File) Kessler noted the stimulus bills \"have excluded some people\" but the law \"did not exclude payments to incarcerated individuals\" and that a judge ruled the IRS \"could not rewrite the law on its own after it had already issued payments to people in prison.\" \"But prisoner advocates say this is just theater,\" Kessler wrote before quoting activists who pushed back at Cotton's claims.\u00a0 Regarding the \"Pinocchio Test,\" Kessler previously concluded that both Cotton and Barrasso's remarks \"lack significant context.\" WAPO GIVES CLAIM BIDEN WILL \u2018SPY\u2019 ON BANK RECORDS \u20183 PINOCCHIOS,\u2019 SAYS WILL \u2018MONITOR\u2019 SUM OF TRANSACTIONS \"Cotton and Barrasso claim Democrats are actively trying to give stimulus checks to murderers and undocumented immigrants. Not only is that wrong, but both voted for previous stimulus bills that did not have narrowed criteria,\" Kessler wrote. \"Barrasso did not resort to Cotton\u2019s scaremongering, more carefully saying that prisoners might receive a stimulus check. But his immigration phrasing was misleading, as viewers might have thought Barrasso was talking about all undocumented immigrants.\" \"Both of these talking points mainly are crafted for future campaign ads, not serious legislation. Cotton and Barrasso earn Two Pinocchio,\" the fact-checker added.\u00a0  (Washington Post/FOX) Well, it turns out that the Boston Bomber did, in fact, receive a $1,400 stimulus check.\u00a0 Records show Tsarnaev, who is currently serving a life sentence after murdering three people and injuring hundreds of others at the 2013 Boston Marathon, has received over $21,000 since his time as an inmate and among the deposits was COVID relief he received in June 2021. There is now an effort by federal officials in Massachusetts to retrieve that $1,400 check among other funds the terrorist has collected while in prison to be put toward the more than $101 million he owes his victims. MEDIA'S \u2018FACT-CHECKERS\u2019 AVOID FALSE NARRATIVE BORDER PATROL AGENTS \u2018WHIPPED\u2019 HAITAN MIGRANTS That forced Kessler to revisit his poorly-aged fact-check after receiving an email from Cotton's press secretary, requesting an update to the 2021 article.\u00a0 \"We take such requests seriously and are always willing to review a fact check in light of new information,\" Kessler wrote in the \"update\" published on Thursday. \"Cotton primarily received the Two-Pinocchio rating because his comments lacked context\u2026 Still, Cotton\u2019s predictive powers should be acknowledged. He said the Boston bomber would get a stimulus check \u2014 and Tsarnaev did.\" \"But in retrospect, the use of the phrase of \u2018scaremongering\u2019 was inappropriate. Cotton had raised a legitimate issue of concern, even if he framed it in a political way. The term \u2018hyped up\u2019 in the headline went too far as well,\" Kessler admitted. \"Thus, we will reduce the rating on this claim to One Pinocchio \u2014 our version of 'mostly true.' His statement still lacks some context but he was certainly correct that Tsarnaev would receive a stimulus check.\" WASHINGTON POST FACT-CHECKER DEFENDS HIS COVERAGE OF BIDEN AFTER INTENSELY MONITORING TRUMP'S CLAIMS Kessler pushed back at a critic who claimed the fact-checker issued a \"correction,\" stressing \"this is an update in light of new information.\" \"It\u2019s important to let readers know if there is something new,\" Kessler tweeted. \"I would argue that a willingness to update and, if necessary, admit mistakes enhances your credibility. In fact acknowledging errors is a core [International Fact-Checking Network] principle.\" Fox News reached out to Kessler for comment. Earlier, Cotton took a victory lap on Twitter, writing, \"Now that the Boston Bomber received his stimulus check from Biden's slush fund, I'm looking forward to the @washingtonpost updating this fact check,\" adding \"Remember\u2014every Democratic Senator voted against my amendment that would have stopped prisoners from getting checks.\" CNN welcomed Washington post fact-checker Glenn Kessler on Thursday to boast about his most popular fact checks of 2021 despite the No. 1 article being widely mocked. \u00a0(ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images) (Getty images / Singerhmk - wiki commons) In June, the Washington Post issued a glaring correction on a 2020 report that accused Cotton of peddling a \"debunked\" \"conspiracy theory\" when he claimed that the coronavirus leaked out of a Wuhan lab in China. \"Earlier versions of this story and its headline inaccurately characterized comments by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) regarding the origins of the coronavirus,\" the correction read at the top of the report. \"The term 'debunked' and The Post\u2019s use of \u2018conspiracy theory\u2019 have been removed because, then as now, there was no determination about the origins of the virus.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The headline was changed to \"Tom Cotton keeps repeating a coronavirus fringe theory that scientists have disputed.\" The media is finally taking the lab-leak theory seriously after the Wall Street Journal reported last year that U.S. intelligence believes that at least three Wuhan scientists were hospitalized with COVID-like symptoms back in November 2019.\u00a0 Fox News' Stephanie Pagones and Brie Stimson contributed to this report.\u00a0 Joseph A.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0\u00a0Sign up here. The IRS sees dead people \u2014\u00a0and apparently pays them too. The Internal Revenue Service, tasked with sending out millions of dollars in stimulus money to thousands of struggling, low- to middle-income Americans, Social Security recipients\u00a0and veterans, has encountered some serious problems carrying out the emergency mission. Instead of getting money into the hands of those needing it most, the IRS has been busy sending $1,200-$2,400 checks to dead people as well as those who don't qualify, like a wealthy British national living in London. MNUCHIN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN SUMMER, SAYS NEW PPP MONEY WILL BE 'DISTRIBUTED FAIRLY' Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has brushed off or downplayed the complaints during media appearances and recently said the families of dead people getting stimulus money should give it back. \"You're not supposed to keep that payment,\" the ex-Hollywood-producer-turned-Trump-administration-official said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \"We're checking the databases, but there could be a scenario where we missed something, and yes, the heirs should be returning that money.\" But, the checks to the deceased aren't just a blip in the system. Evidence seems to indicate the IRS knew some of the checks were being\u00a0issued to dead people. Philip Ray, a Texas lawyer, claimed the tax agency knew his 93-year-old grandmother was dead when it cut her the check. How? Next to her name, the check read, \"decd.\" \"Honestly, I think my grandmother would think this was funny as hell,\" he told The Dallas Morning News, adding, \"This is just an unbelievable level of incompetency.\" Elizabeth B., a British national living in London,\u00a0said she was \"totally shocked\" when she got a check. \"I'm a rich foreigner getting American money. I don't deserve this money.\" \"I never thought it was a possibility that I would get this money,\" she told The Washington Post during a telephone interview from her London home. \"I'm a rich foreigner getting American money. I don't deserve this money.\" She added: \"There are so many people in America who need it. I appreciate that the IRS had to get the money out fast so they couldn't do thorough checks. But it just feels so wrong to have it in my account.\" Elizabeth had worked in New York under an E-2 investor visa for several years as a communications consultant. As required under the conditions of her visa, she had a Social Security number and paid taxes. She made $13,000 for the course of a few months in 2018 before returning to England. Had she worked until the end of the year, her salary would have put her over the $99,000 limit making her ineligible for a stimulus payment. Thousands of people are still waiting for their checks, even as members of the Trump administration and some lawmakers are patting themselves on the back for a job well done. A Treasury spokesperson told Fox News that stimulus money is being delivered to Americans in record time and at a better rate than anticipated. In fact, the last time stimulus checks were sent\u00a0out - in 2008 - it took several months to get out 800,000 checks while this time, over\u00a0120 million checks had been delivered in less than three weeks. Not everyone was celebrating, though. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said the late father of a friend had received a check. Massie called the error \"insane, but just the tip of the iceberg.\" The $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, provided a $1,200 refundable tax credit for qualified individuals and up to $2,400 for qualified joint filers. There's an additional $500 for filers with dependents under 17. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP From the beginning, the government has struggled to keep its promises about the relief checks. Mnuchin's Treasury Department initially promised tens of millions of Americans who qualified for the money would get their payments by the end of day on\u00a0April 15.

        "text": "Games\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., says the investigation must continue under a Biden administration. Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley on Thursday announced new legislation to give direct coronavirus relief to all Americans and families. The bill\u00a0calls for direct payments of $1,200 to all individual Americans and $2,400 to\u00a0families, plus\u00a0$500 per\u00a0children -- the same as those distributed to 80 million Americans in April under the $2.2 trillion CARES Act. \"Americans need direct payments now. Families are struggling. Unemployment claims are rising and food lines are growing. It\u2019s time Congress finally acts,\" Hawley\u00a0said in a statement. He continued: \"Direct payments should be at the center of any Covid relief legislation that Congress passes. If Congress doesn\u2019t pass relief legislation with direct payments in it by next week, I will go to the Senate floor to demand a vote on my legislation.\" DC MAYOR SAYS $1,200 STIMULUS PAYMENTS TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO SOME RESIDENTS The legislation comes as COVID-19 cases\u00a0spike across the country and Congress inches\u00a0toward\u00a0a $908 billion stimulus bill after months of stalled negotiations that excludes $1,200 direct payments to every American. Hawley and Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez came together last week to call for a second stimulus bill that includes checks for individual Americans and families. SANDERS, AOC CRITICIZE $908B CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PROPOSAL FROM BIPARTISAN SENATORS \"I will gladly work w/\u00a0@AOC\u00a0and anyone else who wants to help working families. Families and working people in need should be the FIRST consideration in COVID relief, not last,\" Hawley tweeted on Dec. 4. Hawley is one of the few GOP lawmakers who support stimulus checks like those doled out in March to people earning below a certain amount of money. Other Republicans have bashed the strategy as a \"socialist\" or \"radical\" idea from Democrats. President Trump, however, capitalized on the original proposal, maneuvering to have his name\u00a0inscribed on the checks.

        "text": "Games\nDemocrats and Republicans at odds over unemployment benefits; Chad Pergram reports. The Trump administration is considering taking \"a number of options\"\u00a0without congressional approval as\u00a0negotiations on the fourth coronavirus stimulus relief package are stalled between the White House and lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Fox News has learned. A senior administration official\u00a0told Fox News Monday that the administration is weighing taking unilateral action to quell the economic repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"As the negotiations continue to progress as a snail's pace, the administration is considering a number of options that might be available without congressional legislative action,\"\u00a0the official told Fox News. MCCONNELL UNVEILS 'HEALS' ACT At this point, it is\u00a0unclear what item\u00a0the administration could attempt unilateral action on, but much of the negotiations on Capitol Hill have come to a stalemate with regards to unemployment benefits. \u201cThose that are counting on enhanced unemployment need to be gravely concerned about the lack of progress,\u201d White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told Fox News. \u201cMy recommendation would be for them to call their members of Congress and their senators and ask them why they are not willing to compromise when obviously the White House is willing to compromise.\u201d Meadows added: \u201cThere are two things standing in the way to a deal on enhanced unemployment benefits continuing. One is Sen. [Chuck] Schumer and Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi and the other is a negotiating tactic that puts people at risk.\u201d Enhanced unemployment benefits, which provided an additional $600 per week to those without work, expired at the end of July. Democrats want the next package to continue the $600 weekly payments, but Republicans are concerned that in some cases this results in people collecting more money than they earned from their jobs, disincentivizing them to return to work when possible. The Republican HEALS Act \u2013\u00a0which bears a $1 trillion price tag compared with\u00a0$3 trillion for the Democratic HEROES Act \u2013\u00a0provides an extra\u00a0$200 per week. In the meantime, Republicans offered to continue the $600 payments for one more week while lawmakers negotiate, but Democrats, who proposed their bill in the House back in May, rejected this. FISCAL CONSERVATIVES REVOLT OVER PRICE TAG OF CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE Meadows told Fox News that Democrats rejecting the one-week\u00a0extension of unemployment benefits was \u201cheartless.\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin noted that President Trump is \"very concerned\" about unemployment benefits expiring, adding that\u00a0he was \"surprised\" by the Democrats' refusal. \"They are insistent on having this as part of a larger deal,\" Mnuchin said. Meanwhile, Republican senators have held firm to some of their main priorities in the\u00a0draft proposal, including liability protections for reopening businesses and schools. Mnuchin defended Senate Republicans over the weekend, saying\u00a0their delay in crafting a final proposal for a fourth coronavirus stimulus package was due to their review of the money already spent in previous packages, and whether that money had been used before appropriating additional funding. \u201cWe\u2019ve authorized $3 trillion into the U.S. economy,\u201d Mnuchin said on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d Sunday. \u201cThis has never been done in the history of time.\u201d Mnuchin explained that care was needed in order to properly take into account the competing interests of helping the American public now and protecting them from an inflated debt in the future. Republicans in the Senate last week unveiled their\u00a0$1 trillion coronavirus relief bill, called the HEALS Act, which stands for the package\u2019s focus on Health, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection, and Schools. The bill is the alternative to the House\u2019s HEROES Act, the $3 trillion relief legislation passed in May. The HEALS Act includes $105\u00a0billion in school funding, more than the House offered in its proposal, with the goal of retrofitting schools and universities with coronavirus precautions to open for on-campus learning. It also includes a second round of stimulus checks at the same $1,200 amount as in the CARES Act, along with a \u201csequel\u201d to the Paycheck Protection Program to mitigate layoffs. Liability protections would be included for everyone from doctors and nurses, who would\u00a0be protected from malpractice lawsuits, to churches, charities, businesses and schools, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,\u00a0noted. The hope is that the protections will encourage companies to reopen without fear that they will spend years in court. The bill also includes $16 billion for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing; $20 billion for vaccine, therapeutic and diagnostic development; $20 billion for farmers; and $30 billion to protect the military and defense industrial base from the virus.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. The government and a cybersecurity expert are warning about fresh stimulus payment scams. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury that combats financial crimes, listed some of the most common Economic Impact Payment (EIP) fraud in a recent advisory. The stimulus payments are the third and largest to date of the Coronavirus relief packages over the last 12 months. The government and a cybersecurity expert are warning about fresh stimulus payment scams.  YOUNGEST, OLDEST ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO SCAMS: REPORT Fraudulent checks: Fraudsters send fraudulent checks with instructions to call a number or verify information online. Then the bad guys ask for personal or banking information \"under the guise that the information is needed to receive or speed up their EIP,\" FinCEN's advisory said. The information is then used to commit crimes such as identity theft and the unauthorized access of bank accounts. Theft of payment: these thefts can include stealing an EIP from the U.S. mail or requesting a payment for an ineligible person or seeking another person\u2019s payment without the payee\u2019s knowledge, according to FinCEN. Inappropriate seizure of payments: A private company that controls a person\u2019s finances seizes a person\u2019s EIP and does not return the seized payments. Phishing: fraudsters engage in phishing \u2013 seemingly authentic communications from banks and other trusted entities \u2013 using emails, letters, phone calls, and text messages containing keywords such as \"COVID-19,\" and \"Stimulus.\" The goal is to obtain sensitive personal and financial account information such as account numbers and passwords. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We\u2019ve seen these attacks play out before,\" Evan Reiser, CEO of cybersecurity firm Abnormal Security, told Fox News, referring to phishing attacks. \"When the first stimulus payments were released in April 2020, scammers launched a phishing campaign that impersonated the IRS, claiming that stimulus checks would be withheld unless the recipient updated their address information,\" Reiser said. Victims were directed to a fake IRS log-in\u00a0page that asked for credentials in order to update the requested information and receive a check. \"Those who fell victim to the attack effectively gave away their user names, passwords\u2026 which could allow attackers to steal the stimulus check and/or inflict additional financial damage,\" Reiser said. TOM CRUISE DEEPFAKES ON TIKTOK POINT TO MORE SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH REALISTIC PHONY VIDEOS The schemes target the most vulnerable Americans who have been laid off or had hours reduced, according to Reiser. Some of the most widespread scams are so-called \"out-of-domain impersonation\" techniques where scammers run fraudulent websites that appear\u00a0to be legitimate.

        "text": "Games\nRepublican Rep. Tom Reed and Democrat Rep. Josh Gottheimer emphasize putting country over party to help the American people. The bill to increase stimulus checks to $2,000 from the $600 that was approved before Christmas in the coronavirus stimulus package\u00a0passed the House Tuesday by a narrow margin, getting 275 votes in favor of the boost when the bill needed 272 \"yeas\" to pass.\u00a0 The legislation was brought as a \"suspension\" measure, meaning the House needed two-thirds\u00a0of members present to vote in favor to\u00a0move the bill forward. The House narrowly cleared that hurdle, with 130 Republicans, two Democrats and both of the House's independents voting against the measure.\u00a0 \"Today, I voted against the $435B CASH Act because we cannot continue to endlessly dig our national debt hole deeper,\" Rep. Daniel Lipinski, D-Ill., said in a series of tweets explaining his \"no\" vote. \"Deficit spending during this pandemic is absolutely necessary. If more aid is needed next year, Congress can work on providing that. But fiscal year 2020 (which ended September 30, 2020) recorded a $3.1 trillion deficit which was more than double the previous record.\" MARCO RUBIO BACKS $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS, CALLS FOR CONGRESS TO 'QUICKLY PASS LEGISLATION' He added: \"Federal debt is now larger than the US economy. Austerity should not be instituted now; stimulus is needed. But this does not mean we do not have to consider what we are spending and what debt we are passing onto future generations.\" Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., called the $2,000 checks \"an ineffective and poorly targeted approach to aiding Americans in distress.\" \"It is clearly a last-minute political maneuver by President Trump and extremists on both sides of the political spectrum who have been largely absent during months of hard negotiations,\" Schrader added. \"These funds would be better used for programs like PPP and unemployment insurance that directly benefit small businesses and hardworking families who have been negatively impacted by COVID-19.\" The independents who voted against the checks are Rep. Justin Amash, I-Mich., a former Republican who is fiercely fiscally conservative and Rep. Paul Mitchell, I-Mich., also a former Republican who left the GOP in December over Republicans' refusal to admit that President-elect Joe Biden won the election.\u00a0 Rep.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., released on\u00a0Thursday his proposal for a massive stimulus package that Republicans drafted to ease the financial strains on Americans due to the economic fallout from the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic. The package, which\u00a0costs upwards of $1 trillion and focus on \u201cdirect financial help\u201d to Americans in the form of cash payments, is not a done deal as McConnell will still need to get Democrats -- and a few lingering Republicans -- on board, but his bill outlined a series of measures they hope to see\u00a0included in the final draft of the\u00a0bill, with the biggest one likely being a series of stimulus checks sent out to most Americans. \u201cSenate Republicans want to put cash in the hands of the American people,\u201d McConnell said Thursday, noting that lawmakers are currently finalizing a structure that can quickly send assistance to Americans. MCCONNELL'S CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PLAN WOULD PROVIDE PAYMENTS OF $1,200 PER PERSON, $2,400 FOR COUPLES McConnell indicated job status would not be a factor, and that the money would go to unemployed workers and those recently laid off; those\u00a0still working; and retirees, even if they're already receiving Social Security checks. While officials have indicated the ultra-rich would not be eligible, McConnell said Thursday the checks would still go to everybody \"from the middle class on down. Period.\" What options are being floated? McConnell\u2019s proposal would provide as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per couple in the U.S. The draft legislation, obtained by Fox News, would provide minimum payments of $600, and aid would be phased down at income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. Republicans are also pushing for relief and support for small businesses, and would provide \u201cnew federally guaranteed loans\u201d that he said would \u201caddress immediate cash flow problems.\u201d McConnell said that the Senate was working to let \u201cqualified\u201d small businesses get liquidity through \u201cfamiliar institutions\u201d like their community banks. Another facet that the GOP\u00a0included in the package is\u00a0implementing \u201ctargeted lending\u201d to industries of national importance, like the airline industry. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about so-called bailouts for firms that made reckless decisions,\u201d McConnell said, referencing the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cNo one is alleging a moral hazard here.\u201d \u201cNone of these firms, not corner stores, pizza parlors, not airlines, brought this on themselves,\"\u00a0he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about a taxpayer-funded cushion for companies that made mistakes. We\u2019re talking about loans that must be repaid.\u201d MNUCHIN SAYS WH LOOKING TO SEND $1,000 CHECKS TO MOST AMERICANS WITHIN 3 WEEKS\u00a0 Democratic leadership in the Senate seems to be mostly on the same page with their Republican colleagues, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., saying his party is \u201cready and eager to look at what Republicans put together and to work with them to put together a bipartisan project.\u201d Democrats agree with Republicans on issues like helping small businesses and making sure American workers receive money during the crisis. One concern Democrats do have, however, is that any lending to at-risk industries must include protections for workers\u2019 jobs. There has been widespread criticism of the airline industry for its recent stock buyouts using money that could help the ailing sector during the current pandemic. \u201c[I]f there is going to be a bailout of any sort for industry, worker priorities and worker protections must be included,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. \u201cCorporations should not get a bailout and then be allowed to fire employees or cut their salaries, cut their benefits. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Schumer also wants a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d for the country\u2019s public health infrastructure -- a reference to the massive initiative to help Europe rebuild after World War II. The lack of preparedness and dearth of medical supplies in the U.S. has come under intense scrutiny since the outbreak of the coronavirus reached American shores. \u201cWithout a massive commitment from this Congress, our health care system will not be able to handle this crisis,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThere are not enough workers, not enough supplies, not enough beds, not enough state and local funding. There is a major concern that as this virus spreads that countless Americans will not be able to access or afford treatment if they get the coronavirus.\u201d Democrats also want to step up the money given to working Americans who are unemployed because of the current crisis, with Schumer calling it \u201cunemployment insurance on steroids.\u201d \u201cOur new employment insurance -- an unemployment insurance on steroids -- must have full payment so lost salaries are totally made up for, it must be quick and easy to access, and it must be broad-based,\" Schumer said. \u201cDemocrats will ask for that as one of our most important asks because that goes to the people who need help.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Gregg Re, Brooke Singman and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

        "text": "Games\nThe group comprised families and single adults from Venezuela, Texas DPS said.\u00a0 A new report is highlighting how federal COVID funds were used in Washington state to give $1,000 checks to illegal immigrants who were ineligible to receive federal economic impact payments during the pandemic due to their immigration status. The report, by the Economic Policy Innovation Center (EPIC), points to money administered by the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (SLFRF), which was created by the American Rescue Plan Act and was intended to help state and local governments with their response and recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Washington state received $4.4 billion in funding overall from that program. The report from the group, which calls for a smaller federal government, highlighted how $340 million in funding went to a program that sent $1,000 checks to illegal immigrants in the state. The funds, approved by the Washington state legislature in April 2021, provided \"another round of funding for undocumented Washingtonians,\" according to an impact report on the program said. MIGRANT CRISIS BROKE NEW RECORD IN DECEMBER WITH 302K ENCOUNTERS A woman walks by a street poster depicting Lady Liberty preventing an immigrant family from crossing the wall, during a \"Defund the Police\" march from King County Youth Jail to City Hall in Seattle, Washington on August 5, 2020.\u00a0 ((Photo by JASON REDMOND/AFP via Getty Images)) The Washington COVID-19 Immigrant Relief Fund was first set up in 2020 to grant checks to those ineligible for government assistance programs due to their immigration status. Treasury documents confirm that the state has since provided an extra $340 million in federal relief funds for the one-time cash grants, with 10% of the funding went to community-based organizations to administer the program.\u00a0 BIDEN CLAIMS \u2018I\u2019VE DONE ALL I CAN DO' TO SECURE THE BORDER\u00a0 \"The $340 million project is categorized as a \u2018cash transfer\u2019 expenditure under the SLFRF, approved for the State of Washington. This means the Biden Administration directly subsidized \u2018undocumented\u2019 immigration under the guise of COVID-19 pandemic relief,\" the EPIC report said. The state said that it had previously invested $128 million of funding from the Trump-era CARES Act for 120,000 immigrants who did not qualify for economic relief, but the funding was not sufficient for the number of applications the program received. The fund has now ended, with the last payments going out in early 2023. State officials said the fund was an opportunity \"to help people who may have been left out of other federal and state resources to address the economic impact of the pandemic.\" The Economic Policy Innovation Center report highlights several other projects related to illegal immigration for which federal funds were used, including programs in Arizona for art, music and dance classes for migrants and expansion of shelters in Massachusetts. \"The Senate is releasing a budget supplemental that includes a bipartisan deal on the border. However, the administration has been actively encouraging illegal immigration by using COVID money from the SLFRF to provide cash assistance, housing, legal aid, and other benefits to undocumented immigrants,\" Paul Winfree, president and CEO of EPIC, told Fox News Digital. Winfree also stressed that there is still $120 billion in unspent money from the fund, and called on lawmakers to stop those funds. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Until Congress claws back this money, it will continue to serve as a magnet for illegal immigration,\" he said. The report comes amid continued concern about the flow of illegal immigrants into the U.S. Congress is currently negotiating a supplemental funding bill, which would include aid to communities receiving migrants. But Republicans have sought to include restrictions on asylum and the administration\u2019s use of parole.

        "text": "Games\nPresident Trump signs $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. President Trump on Friday signed a more than $2 trillion legislative package to combat the coronavirus pandemic and send economic relief to workers and businesses squeezed by restrictions meant to stop the outbreak\u2019s spread after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the legislation earlier in the day. \"I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first,\" Trump said during an afternoon Oval Office signing ceremony. Trump marveled at the magnitude of the aid package as he penned his name on the legislation:\u00a0\"I've never signed anything with a 'T' on it,\" Trump quipped of the trillions of dollars of new spending. The legislation, approved by voice vote despite 11th-hour drama arising from a GOP lawmaker\u2019s objections, amounts to the costliest stimulus plan in U.S. history. It includes checks for most Americans, boosted unemployment aid, help for small business as well as a massive loan fund for corporations \u2013 at a time when unemployment is surging at a record pace, a consequence of businesses closing in compliance with social distancing guidelines. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW \u201cThis bill is not only a rescue package, it is a commitment...that your government and the people whom you\u00a0elected to serve will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future,\u201d House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said prior to the vote.\u00a0\"To the American public:\u00a0If you do your part, I promise we will do ours.\" The approval, while widely anticipated, followed a stretch of uncertainty over whether one congressman -- concerned about the stunning cost of the package -- might be able to stall the vote. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had furiously objected to a simple voice vote that would have required only a minimal number of lawmakers to travel. Massie, as part of his push, wanted to\u00a0ensure there is a quorum, which would require half of the members to show up on Capitol Hill. So as President Trump and others accused him of grandstanding, hundreds of lawmakers were summoned to Washington D.C. Thursday night and Friday morning from coronavirus-ravaged communities in New York, California and elsewhere. This, despite\u00a0strict guidelines from the Capitol physician advising lawmakers\u00a0not to congregate at the Capitol and to stay in their offices until needed\u00a0to avoid the spread of the virus that has already infected several lawmakers. \u201cMassie has now become the most hated person on Capitol Hill,\" said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who left his home at 4:30 a.m. to drive to the Capitol to ensure the measure got passed Friday. While Massie was able to ensure many lawmakers showed up for the vote, he was not, in the end, able to force a roll-call. The House, after several hours of debate, ultimately passed the measure by voice vote, and it was allowed to stand. There were loud cries for \u2018ayes\u2019 and few rumblings of \u2018nos\u2019 on the House floor. \u201cThe ayes have it,\u201d declared the presiding officer, Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Md. But Massie stood up and objected. \u201cI came here to make sure our republic doesn\u2019t die by unanimous consent in an empty chamber and I request a recorded vote,\u201d Massie said. Brown ruled that an insufficient number of lawmakers stood in support of a roll call vote. But Massie pressed on. \u201cI object on the basis that a quorum is not present,\u201d Massie said, instructing a count of lawmakers. \u201cA quorum is present and the motion is adopted,\u201d Brown ruled, to applause. Minutes before the vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi took to the floor to summon social-distancing lawmakers at the Capitol in an effort to gather quorum and shut down the Massie effort. Pelosi touted the aid forthcoming for\u00a0Americans and small businesses, while acknowledging that more needs\u00a0to be done for state and local governments and the frontline healthcare workers. She paid homage to a nurse manager, Kious\u00a0Kelly, who died from coronavirus after\u00a0serving at a New York City hospital that had to resort to using plastic garbage bags as gowns. \u201cWe know that this cannot be our final bill,\u201d Pelosi said. In a series of speeches prior to the historic rescue bill, lawmakers pressed for national unity despite the bill's imperfections. \u201cWe're going to help Americans through this,\" McCarthy said. \"We're going to do this together and in the end, we are going to be healthier, stronger and more united than ever before, because as Americans, that's who we are.\u201d Upon catching wind of the plan to stop a roll-call vote, though, Massie howled on Twitter over the parliamentary machinations. \"It\u2019s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY. Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote? #SWAMP,\" he tweeted. After the voice vote, Massie accused Pelosi and McCarthy of trying to shield their members from the political ramifications. \"There's a big cover up in there,\" Massie said as he exited the Capitol. Emotions ran hot on the House floor all morning Friday before the vote on the $2 trillion stimulus bill. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., started her impassioned floor speech by noting 13 people died in one day at Queen\u2019s Elmhurst Hospital and medical professionals still don\u2019t have enough ventilators and personal protection equipment. She ripped the Senate for fighting for corporate bailouts that will contribute to\u00a0the income inequality gap\u00a0in order for families to get \u201ccrumbs.\u201d \u201cWhat did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful!\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., said he\u2019s \u201cdistressed by the Hobson\u2019s choice\" lawmakers face of having to\u00a0accept unrelated spending sprees in order to\u00a0send relief. \u201cNo more billion-dollar bailouts for things that are unrelated. No more policies that are long-standing for a short-standing issue that needs our critical attention,\u201d Perry said. In a bizarre and seemingly unnecessary point of drama, Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., refused to stop speaking when her time ran out on the House floor, even though Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was willing to let her finish if she had just paused to let him officially grant her more time. Instead, Stevens continued yelling and held up her hands \u2013 clad with pink surgical gloves\u2014in an apparent homage to front line healthcare workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic even though her mic was cut. As the presiding officer\u00a0was pounding the gavel and ruling Stevens \u201cout of order,\u201d Stevens screamed, \u201cdo not be afraid!\u201d Republicans, who are trying hard to flip the freshman rep\u2019s seat in November, immediately pounced on the outburst as a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d The bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House's best guess of the spending it contains. The legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. Unemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis. The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. All would be up to the Treasury Department's discretion, though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible. There was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads. Frustrations were already hot as lawmakers had to return to Washington in a panic after\u00a0Massie, R-Ky., threatened to upend plans for a simple voice vote with as few lawmakers as possible. \u201cTo you who oppose this bill: Please, please stand down,\" Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., pleaded on the House floor.\u00a0 \"We can't wait another day to help. Don't add to this disruption\u00a0by, in fact, being a disruptor. Be a leader.\" Lawmakers spoke passionately about how COVID-19 is hurting the health of their communities and how the widespread shutdown of the economy is crippling families and businesses. Yet many openly grappled with voting in favor of bill they believe will be helpful, while it\u2019s chock-full of other provisions that they disagree with. \u201cThis is ripping my heart out because there\u2019s things in this bill that just don\u2019t belong there.\u00a0I consider them--,\" Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., said, stopping\u00a0himself midsentence. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t say that word in front of a microphone.\u201d Schweikert, however, argued Congress must \u201cdo the right thing\u201d by passing the legislation. However, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., said he\u00a0opposed the legislation over cost and debt concerns. \"As President Trump said, we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,\" Buck said.

        "text": "Games\nIn media news today, an MSNBC reporter warns that Republicans in state legislature are passing voting laws that make 'January 6 every day,\u2019 a CNN medical guest says that companies should not treat the unvaccinated and vaccinated as equal, and a White House reporter asks Jen Psaki why Biden hasn\u2019t \u2018focused more on scolding the unvaccinated.\u2019 Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler offered a mea culpa of sorts after having rewarded two Pinocchios to Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., for predicting that murderers like convicted terrorist Dzhokhar Tsarnaev would receive a COVID stimulus check.\u00a0 In March 2021, Kessler ran the headline \"Murderers, undocumented immigrants: Hyped-up claims about who\u2019s getting stimulus checks\" with an image of Cotton plastered on the page, challenging claims that he and Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wy., made that the $1,400 checks Americans were set to receive would be going to those not qualified or worthy for them.\u00a0 WASHINGTON POST ISSUES \u2018CORRECTION\u2019 ON 2020 TOM COTTON STORY CLAIMING COVID LAB-LEAK THEORY WAS \u2018DEBUNKED\u2019 \"On March 8, [Cotton] tweeted that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the Boston bomber, would also get benefits and declared, \u2018Get ready for campaign ads,\u2019\" Kessler wrote at the time, quoting Cotton. \"But for all the hype, there\u2019s less to these claims than one might imagine \u2014 particularly because the previous stimulus bills passed last year under GOP control also did not bar payments to prisoners and the small subset of undocumented immigrants referenced by Barrasso.\" ILE - This file photo released April 19, 2013, by the Federal Bureau of Investigation shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, convicted and sentenced to death for carrying out the April 15, 2013 Boston Marathon bombing attack that killed three people and injured more than 260. (FBI via AP, File) (FBI via AP, File) Kessler noted the stimulus bills \"have excluded some people\" but the law \"did not exclude payments to incarcerated individuals\" and that a judge ruled the IRS \"could not rewrite the law on its own after it had already issued payments to people in prison.\" \"But prisoner advocates say this is just theater,\" Kessler wrote before quoting activists who pushed back at Cotton's claims.\u00a0 Regarding the \"Pinocchio Test,\" Kessler previously concluded that both Cotton and Barrasso's remarks \"lack significant context.\" WAPO GIVES CLAIM BIDEN WILL \u2018SPY\u2019 ON BANK RECORDS \u20183 PINOCCHIOS,\u2019 SAYS WILL \u2018MONITOR\u2019 SUM OF TRANSACTIONS \"Cotton and Barrasso claim Democrats are actively trying to give stimulus checks to murderers and undocumented immigrants. Not only is that wrong, but both voted for previous stimulus bills that did not have narrowed criteria,\" Kessler wrote. \"Barrasso did not resort to Cotton\u2019s scaremongering, more carefully saying that prisoners might receive a stimulus check. But his immigration phrasing was misleading, as viewers might have thought Barrasso was talking about all undocumented immigrants.\" \"Both of these talking points mainly are crafted for future campaign ads, not serious legislation. Cotton and Barrasso earn Two Pinocchio,\" the fact-checker added.\u00a0  (Washington Post/FOX) Well, it turns out that the Boston Bomber did, in fact, receive a $1,400 stimulus check.\u00a0 Records show Tsarnaev, who is currently serving a life sentence after murdering three people and injuring hundreds of others at the 2013 Boston Marathon, has received over $21,000 since his time as an inmate and among the deposits was COVID relief he received in June 2021. There is now an effort by federal officials in Massachusetts to retrieve that $1,400 check among other funds the terrorist has collected while in prison to be put toward the more than $101 million he owes his victims. MEDIA'S \u2018FACT-CHECKERS\u2019 AVOID FALSE NARRATIVE BORDER PATROL AGENTS \u2018WHIPPED\u2019 HAITAN MIGRANTS That forced Kessler to revisit his poorly-aged fact-check after receiving an email from Cotton's press secretary, requesting an update to the 2021 article.\u00a0 \"We take such requests seriously and are always willing to review a fact check in light of new information,\" Kessler wrote in the \"update\" published on Thursday. \"Cotton primarily received the Two-Pinocchio rating because his comments lacked context\u2026 Still, Cotton\u2019s predictive powers should be acknowledged. He said the Boston bomber would get a stimulus check \u2014 and Tsarnaev did.\" \"But in retrospect, the use of the phrase of \u2018scaremongering\u2019 was inappropriate. Cotton had raised a legitimate issue of concern, even if he framed it in a political way. The term \u2018hyped up\u2019 in the headline went too far as well,\" Kessler admitted. \"Thus, we will reduce the rating on this claim to One Pinocchio \u2014 our version of 'mostly true.' His statement still lacks some context but he was certainly correct that Tsarnaev would receive a stimulus check.\" WASHINGTON POST FACT-CHECKER DEFENDS HIS COVERAGE OF BIDEN AFTER INTENSELY MONITORING TRUMP'S CLAIMS Kessler pushed back at a critic who claimed the fact-checker issued a \"correction,\" stressing \"this is an update in light of new information.\" \"It\u2019s important to let readers know if there is something new,\" Kessler tweeted. \"I would argue that a willingness to update and, if necessary, admit mistakes enhances your credibility. In fact acknowledging errors is a core [International Fact-Checking Network] principle.\" Fox News reached out to Kessler for comment. Earlier, Cotton took a victory lap on Twitter, writing, \"Now that the Boston Bomber received his stimulus check from Biden's slush fund, I'm looking forward to the @washingtonpost updating this fact check,\" adding \"Remember\u2014every Democratic Senator voted against my amendment that would have stopped prisoners from getting checks.\" CNN welcomed Washington post fact-checker Glenn Kessler on Thursday to boast about his most popular fact checks of 2021 despite the No. 1 article being widely mocked. \u00a0(ERIC BARADAT/AFP via Getty Images) (Getty images / Singerhmk - wiki commons) In June, the Washington Post issued a glaring correction on a 2020 report that accused Cotton of peddling a \"debunked\" \"conspiracy theory\" when he claimed that the coronavirus leaked out of a Wuhan lab in China. \"Earlier versions of this story and its headline inaccurately characterized comments by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) regarding the origins of the coronavirus,\" the correction read at the top of the report. \"The term 'debunked' and The Post\u2019s use of \u2018conspiracy theory\u2019 have been removed because, then as now, there was no determination about the origins of the virus.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The headline was changed to \"Tom Cotton keeps repeating a coronavirus fringe theory that scientists have disputed.\" The media is finally taking the lab-leak theory seriously after the Wall Street Journal reported last year that U.S. intelligence believes that at least three Wuhan scientists were hospitalized with COVID-like symptoms back in November 2019.\u00a0 Fox News' Stephanie Pagones and Brie Stimson contributed to this report.\u00a0 Joseph A.

        "text": "Games\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed President Trump\u00a0on Wednesday for calling off COVID-19 relief negotiations, then offering to approve a standalone bill on stimulus checks. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting that he said he\u2019d send out those checks if we sent him that bill, because all he has ever wanted in the negotiation was to send out a check with his name on it,\u201d the California Democrat told ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View.\" She added:\u00a0\u201cForget about the virus, forget about our heroes, forget about our children and their need to go to school safely.\u201d Trump abruptly postponed coronavirus relief negotiations Tuesday so the Senate could go all-in on working to confirm Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the open Supreme Court seat. The president\u00a0accused Pelosi of pushing for a $2.4 trillion package that would act as a bailout to \u201cpoorly run, high crime, Democrat States.\u201d He said Republicans had made a \u201cgenerous\u201d $1.6 trillion offer, which she rejected. House Democrats instead passed a $2.2 trillion package last week that has no chance of\u00a0 making it through the Republican-held Senate. PELOSI CITES FED'S POWELL IN LATEST PUSH FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF AID Reversing course hours later, after the stock market tanked, Trump pushed for a standalone bill to approve $1,200 stimulus checks and\u00a0telling Pelosi to \u201cmove fast.\u201d Trump also called on Congress to pass piecemeal relief measures for the ailing airline industry and to replenish the Paycheck Protection Program, utilizing unspent CARES Act funds. Pelosi has held steadfast on passing a broader relief package. TRUMP URGES CONGRESS TO PASS MORE CORONAVIRUS AID HOURS AFTER BREAKING OFF NEGOTIATIONS\u00a0 \"It\u2019s hard to see any clear sane path on what he\u2019s doing, but the fact is he saw the political downside of his statement of walking away from the negotiations,\" she told \u201cThe View.\u201d He\u2019s rebounding from a terrible mistake he made yesterday, and the Republicans in Congress are going down the drain with him on that.\" Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke on the phone Wednesday morning to discuss a second bailout for the airline industry. Last week, U.S. airlines began cutting 35,000 jobs following the expiration of a $25 billion bailout fund that was created earlier this year as part of the CARES Act. Under the terms of the agreement, airlines were prohibited from cutting jobs or reducing workers' pay through Sept. 30. \u201cThe secretary inquired about a standalone airlines bill,\"\u00a0Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill tweeted of the speaker\u2019s meeting with Mnuchin. \"The speaker reminded him that Republicans blocked that bill on Friday & asked him to review the DeFazio bill so that they could have an informed conversation.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Last week, Republicans blocked an attempt by Democrats to pass by unanimous consent a standalone airline bill introduced by House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. A House GOP aide told The Hill that Republicans were still waiting for details on that bill, and pointed to a different one they supported, introduced by Reps. Stacey Plaskett, D-V.I., and David Joyce, R-Ohio. \u201cThis is incompetent and sloppy process,\u201d the aide said. \u201cOnce again Democrats are using partisan gimmicks rather than bipartisan solutions.\u201d Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

        "text": "Games\nThis is a rush transcript from \u201cYour World\" October 7, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:\u00a0 About yesterday, Bill, it was all an illusion, because those talks are back on and stimulus might happen after all. \u00a0 The Dow Jones industrials sprinting ahead, at its highs of the day, up almost 530 points, and all on word that the president of the United States, well, if he didn't do a 180, he did pivot a little bit, saying that he is still open to some form of stimulus, maybe something more selective, like $1,200 checks that could come out to help people, as they did in the beginning of the pandemic, or maybe relief for the airline industry, and leave it at. \u00a0 That was an encouraging development that maybe stimulus wouldn't have to sort of chill until after the election or longer. But is that enough to keep it going? \u00a0 Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is YOUR WORLD, where, at this moment, we're learning that the president of the United States is back in the Oval Office. He's getting a briefing on, well, lots of stuff.  \u00a0 Let's get the latest read right now with John Roberts and a full 180, certainly for the markets, sensing that there is a different vibe in town - - John. \u00a0 JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Full 180 for the markets, Neil, but I'm not sure about a full 180 in terms of coronavirus relief and where we really stand on it. \u00a0 The president in the Oval Office for the first time since returning from Walter Reed Military Medical Center for a briefing on the hurricane that is soon going to slam into the Gulf Coast, another one -- yet again, it's going to happen -- and what could potentially happen with the coronavirus relief bill.  \u00a0 You remember yesterday the president saying negotiations have been suspended until after the election. Now the president coming back and urging Nancy Pelosi to, if not do something comprehensive, do it piece by piece, starting with payments to individuals.  \u00a0 The president tweeted -- quote -- \"If I am set a stand-alone bill for stimulus checks, $1,200, they will go out to our great people immediately.  I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening, Nancy?\" \u00a0 As it turns out, Nancy Pelosi was listening and said this about that idea: \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):\u00a0 All he has ever wanted in the negotiation was to send out a check with his name printed on it. Forget about the virus.  Forget about our heroes. Forget about our children and their need to go to school safely and the rest.  \u00a0 So, he's just, again, rebounding from a terrible mistake that he made yesterday, and the Republicans in Congress were going down the drain with him on that.  \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 ROBERTS:\u00a0 Pelosi claimed today that the president did not inform her that he was going to suspend the talks yesterday, that she learned about it the way everybody else did, when he tweeted about it.  \u00a0 There is another idea out there though, Neil. There is money left over from the first big coronavirus relief bill, about $146 billion worth, that could be turned toward things like paycheck protection, relief for the airlines, enhanced unemployment benefits and other items.  \u00a0 But that would require legislation from Congress, Mark Meadows saying this, this morning.  \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 MARK MEADOWS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:\u00a0 The stimulus negotiations are off. Obviously, we're looking at the potential for stand-alone bills. \u00a0 There's about 10 things that we agree on. And if the speaker is willing to look at those things on a piece-by-piece basis, then we're willing to look at it.  \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 ROBERTS:\u00a0 Now, obviously, as you see down there in the right-hand corner of your screen, the Dow looking at this and going, yes, we may get a deal.  \u00a0 But here's the thing, Neil. They tried to do something very similar a month ago in a skinny relief bill. And Nancy Pelosi said no, that she's not going below $2.2 trillion, and that it needs to be a comprehensive relief package.  \u00a0 So I don't know why she would suddenly capitulate and say, you know, you're right, let's do this piece by piece. So, this may be so much wishful thinking on the part of the White House. We will see.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Yes. Well, the market is known for being manic. So we will see what happens.  \u00a0 (LAUGHTER) \u00a0 ROBERTS:\u00a0 Yes.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 John Roberts, thank you very, very much, my friend.  \u00a0 ROBERTS:\u00a0 To say the least. \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 In the meantime, I want to go to Jacqui Heinrich here getting ready for the big vice presidential debate.  \u00a0 No doubt this twisting and turning on stimulus and all will come up.  \u00a0 Jacqui, we're less than, what, five hours away right now. What can you tell us?  \u00a0 JACQUI HEINRICH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Hey there, Neil.  \u00a0 Well, Senator Kamala Harris has been reportedly doing debate prep, with South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg doing the mock debate posing as Vice President Pence, who, by the way, is also from Indiana. \u00a0 And the campaign said this morning they don't expect that Pence is going to try to interrupt, like President Trump did in the first debate, but they do expect him to lie and distort and take the focus off of his administration.  \u00a0 (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) \u00a0 SYMONE SANDERS, BIDEN CAMPAIGN SENIOR ADVISER:\u00a0 You expect my sense to have a good debate. He has a history of being a successful debater. He was a talk show host.  \u00a0 So, look, we are not coming in underestimating him. I mean, look no further than Mike Pence's RNC speech. \u00a0 But just because Mike Pence can deliver a line doesn't make it true. It's easy to win a debate if you don't care about telling the truth.  \u00a0 (END AUDIO CLIP) \u00a0 HEINRICH:\u00a0 The campaign said Harris, a prosecutor, is a natural fact- checker. \u00a0 But her bigger focus will be the issues Americans are facing under a recession and a pandemic, all happening under this Trump administration.  And because that was already the aim of her preparation, prominent Democrats don't think she's had to adjust attack lines very much, even with the president battling coronavirus. \u00a0 Former Bernie Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver studied Harris when Bernie faced her in the primary debates. He says her skill is distilling a complicated issue to a simple message. He expects Harris will focus on the agenda, which was not laid out by President Trump in the first debate.  \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 JEFF WEAVER, FORMER BERNIE SANDERS CAMPAIGN MANAGER:\u00a0 If you look at the first debate in terms of tone, obviously, the president's performance was widely panned, including by many Republicans, who felt that his constant interrupting and distraction, in fact, hurt his ability to make his case for a second term.  \u00a0 And Senator Harris is a very accomplished debater. Believe me, we debated her a number of times.  \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 HEINRICH:\u00a0 Now, during the first debate, President Trump tried to bait Joe Biden into angering the far left of his party, saying, \"You just lost the left\" a number of times. \u00a0 And you saw Biden kind of distance himself from progressive policies a little bit. Weaver said it didn't have an impact with progressives. They are united against President Trump.  \u00a0 But, on the other end, they do expect potentially Mike Pence will take the opposite approach and paint Harris and the Democratic ticket as part of the radical left -- Neil. \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Jacqui Heinrich. \u00a0 Thank you very much, Jacqui, in Salt Lake City for that big event. \u00a0 Just to lay out sort of the ground rules on all of this, the two candidates will be separated by about 12 feet, so double the normal distance of six feet recommended in this COVID age. There will be Plexiglas between them. \u00a0 We haven't had a chance to appreciate how that helps or hurts and how it looks. But we will find out pretty soon later on, won't we? \u00a0 And then there's the issue of them sitting down. For most of the vice presidential debates in recent years, save the 2008 contest featuring Sarah Palin against Joe Biden, when they were standing, all the V.P. affairs have been largely done sitting at a table.  \u00a0 And I think that, on a level, that kind of brings the tension down. They're talking to each other more directly, even given distance.  \u00a0 And, sometimes, you get a pretty sound and substantive debate, like what happened 20 years ago this month, when my next guest, Joe Lieberman, sat down at a table to have a very good, cogent view of various political philosophies, without hitting each other, interrupting each other, shouting at each other, or throwing food each other, maybe because they didn't provide food.  \u00a0 (LAUGHTER) \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 But, if they had, I suspect, Joe Lieberman, and, by the way, Dick Cheney wouldn't have taken the bait or the bun.  \u00a0 Joe Lieberman joins me right now.  \u00a0 Senator, very good to have you.  \u00a0 (CROSSTALK) \u00a0 FMR. SEN. JOE LIEBERMAN (I-CT):\u00a0 ... be with you, Neil.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 I do think it makes a difference sitting down, you know? I think it makes a big difference.  \u00a0 What do you think?  \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 Yes, I mean, you wouldn't think so.  \u00a0 But I think it does. I think it tends to encourage less fisticuffs and more discussion like you're sitting in a living room or something like that.  \u00a0 But, look, the most important thing tonight is that this debate, for the sake of the country, be different than the first Trump-Biden debate, which was chaotic, embarrassing, and I think bad for the country.  \u00a0 I think these two can have a good debate tonight, in which they will differ, but they will do it in a way that's mutually respectful. I think the country really needs that right now. \u00a0 Now, strategically, at this moment, the Trump/Pence ticket seems to be going down a bit in the polling. So the pressure is on the vice president to sort of rebuild the support for the president and him.  \u00a0 And he's a skilled debater. And, of course, Kamala Harris, Senator Harris, will try very hard not to let him rebuild that support and to make her case and Vice President Biden's against the current administration.  \u00a0 I think it's going to be a really good debate, and two good people on the stage sitting down.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 You know, what's getting the focus, as you know, Senator, since the presidential candidates are not spring chickens -- we will just leave it at -- the attention is going to be focused on these two as one of them is going to be a future president.  \u00a0 We could be looking at the next battle four years from now. Who knows? But it's going to get more scrutiny than even yours did some four years ago -- 20 years ago, I should say, with Dick Cheney. \u00a0 What do you think of that, that it has changed the equation a little bit?  \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 No, I think that will be in people's minds.  \u00a0 I mean, these are the two oldest candidates to run at once for president in our history. And we have had one, Vice President Biden, who had an illness earlier in his life, seems in good shape now.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Yes.  \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 President Trump just got COVID-19.  \u00a0 So, yes, I think people will be evaluating these two people, Mike Pence, Kamala Harris, as -- look, let's hope and pray that whoever gets elected president lives out the time of their service.  \u00a0 But even if that's the cases, as we hope, the two vice presidential candidates are naturals to be the head of the ticket next time, certainly the one that's on the ticket that gets elected.  \u00a0 So, no, I think there will be a separate view of this. Also, there's a certain number of people out there, Neil, I think, who are not quite sure who to vote for yet, believe it or not, and the vice presidential performances tonight may help them decide.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Yes, you could be right about that.  \u00a0 There was talk today that Joe Biden, the first time, said, I want to make sure the president is testing negatively on the coronavirus, more or less saying, if he isn't, we're not having a debate.  \u00a0 How likely you think something like that is?  \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 Well, I mean, the president will continue to be tested, and will be under pressure to reveal it as we get closer to the next presidential debate.  \u00a0 I think it's going to happen. I don't think -- now, Vice President Biden may ask for some separation that's greater between the two of them. But that debate will happen, and it should happen, because the country is about to make a really important decision at a very difficult... \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Yes, I'm wondering -- but I'm wondering, Senator, whether you could still have it, but virtually. There is some precedent for that.  \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 Right.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 In the third JFK-Nixon debates, I believe that Kennedy at the time was at the ABC studios in New York, Richard Nixon at the ABC studios in L.A.  \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 Right.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Now, I know that was the third debate. The fourth one, they were both together again.  \u00a0 By that time -- the first debate generally makes the biggest impression.  That's where John Kennedy took what was a bit of a gap behind Richard Nixon, moved out front, and never looked back.  \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 Right.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 But I'm wondering if that is a model that the candidates can use now, if it came to that. \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 Oh, it's definitely a model.  \u00a0 And, look, it was unusual at that point. But, today, everybody's doing everything virtually and at a distance. \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 True. \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 And I think it might be a way to go if there are any concerns.  Of course, both of them have to agree to do it that way.  \u00a0 Also, frankly, I think, a debate that's -- where they're separated and on screens, distant, but talking to each other, is also more likely to be a substantive debate, and at least not a chaotic, I'm going to interrupt you every moment, and I'm going to fight back at your interruptions, debate.  \u00a0 I mean, again, I say that debate hurt the country, it hurt our image in the world. For the sake of our country, I hope tonight's a lot different and that the next two presidential debates are a lot better than that first one.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Yes, don't get me started, Senator. The Lincoln-Douglas debates, I remember covering those. And, boy, what a nightmare.  \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 Yes.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Anyway, Senator, it's always good... \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 Yes, I was... \u00a0 (LAUGHTER) \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 I looked for you in the crowd that day, but I couldn't find you. \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Yes. Yes. I was way, way back. It's good seeing you, Senator.  \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 Well, you were... \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 And happy memories of 20 -- 20 years ago.  \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 Thanks.  \u00a0 I do have great -- it was a great debate. I'm proud to have been part of it. And I think it was a win-win debate. \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 It was very -- I'm not blowing you smoke, but it was very solid and substantive. \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 Thanks. \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 It shows what these things can be if you set your mind to it. \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 I hope tonight... \u00a0 (CROSSTALK) \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Joe Lieberman. \u00a0 LIEBERMAN:\u00a0 Be well. \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Thank you, sir, very, very much, the former vice presidential candidate. \u00a0 Twenty years ago this month, he was at that table on that stage with Dick Cheney. And it really was substantive. That is something that can happen positive.  \u00a0 I don't know if that goes these days. But we will see.  \u00a0 All right, in the meantime, just to remind you, we will be covering this tonight as well, not only on FOX, but on FOX Business. And, of course, it all kicks off at 8:00 p.m. It will continue with the debate itself and afterwards, a one-stop shop there, where you can get foreign market reaction and our own futures trading reaction.  \u00a0 This is something we have done since, of course, we first went on the air FOX Business and for FOX News itself, looking at the business implications of this.  \u00a0 So, again, it's something fascinating to watch. If you think our country is really into this, you should see how foreign countries react to this -- after this.  \u00a0 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, we are still honoring the president. He's back in the Oval Office here.  \u00a0 We're also taking a look right now at the key issue for voters. And the economy still, no pun intended, trumps all the others, from national security, education, health care, even the pandemic response. \u00a0 If that is the case, and given the improving economy, why isn't the president doing better in overall polls? In fact, the ones we're seeing right now, he is slip-sliding away nationally against Joe Biden and even in some of those battleground states.  \u00a0 I suspect Frank Luntz has some ideas.  \u00a0 Frank, what's going on? That's a big old disconnect, isn't it?  \u00a0 FRANK LUNTZ, POLLSTER:\u00a0 Well, there's two points here.  \u00a0 Number one is, the economy is important to more people than any other issue. But in terms of intensity, those who care about COVID care more about COVID than those who care about the economy care about the economy.  \u00a0 Second is that the economy is a -- an outgrowth of COVID, so that people who lost their jobs don't blame the economy. They blame COVID. People who are looking for work, people who've had their hours cut, people who are economically challenged, they see COVID as the cause. And so they're looking for that kind of solution.  \u00a0 And, second, Trump has the advantage on the economy, but he keeps talking about the stock market. In the work that we have done, jobs, how many jobs exist, how many jobs have been lost, the issue of jobs outranks every other economic issue.  \u00a0 Now, Donald Trump has the advantage on the economy over Joe Biden by a small margin. But that's not been enough. And you know why? Because he talks about everything else, that this president does not have the discipline, does not have the focus on those things that voters might vote for him over.  \u00a0 And they never even got a chance to hear his difference between him and Joe Biden because of his behavior in the last presidential debate.  \u00a0 So, Neil, you're correct in your assertion. But the president is not getting the advantage on the economy because voters don't understand what he's done or what he will do. And it's because of how he presents his answers.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 So, does that put pressure on Mike Pence to try to make things right tonight? How much does the needle move based on what the number two guys are saying?  \u00a0 LUNTZ:\u00a0 It's got a tremendous potential because of the point you made earlier, that these are the oldest presidential candidates.  \u00a0 But Mike Pence, we went through this back in 2016. And you're a historian.  Everyone assumed that Pence was going to lose that debate, that Tim Kaine was a better debater, more articulate. But Pence did well, because Kaine came after him, and Pence just did not behave that way.  \u00a0 If you go back and look at the numbers, Mike Pence righted the Trump ship after Donald Trump's first debate performance, which, in his mind, was pretty positive, in everybody else's mind, wasn't that successful.  \u00a0 I think Pence has a lot of pressure on him tonight to do exactly the same thing. But you know what? I actually think the more pressure is on Kamala Harris. She took Joe Biden down, and she's going to have to have an explanation better than, it's a debate, for why she challenged him so hard, and did so much damage to his campaign, to his candidacy.  \u00a0 I think she's got to figure out how to modulate herself to demonstrate that she is different, that she is preferable, but that she's not angry, and that she's not so partisan in her approach, that she turns off undecided voters.  \u00a0 So, actually, Neil, you know what the truth is? They both are under pressure tonight.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Yes, that's probably the case.  \u00a0 Frank, Joe Biden wants to make sure the president is cleared of this COVID- 19-positive diagnosis, that he's COVID-clear. If that were not the case, and this were pushed back, does it risk no more presidential debates? Or do you skip to the third one and leave it at that?  \u00a0 In other words, what is the risk for either candidate if there are no more presidential debates?  \u00a0 LUNTZ:\u00a0 I will be blunt with you. If there are no more presidential debates, then Joe Biden is the next president of the United States.  \u00a0 And I have no hesitation in saying that. I know that there will be eruptions all over 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Donald Trump needs those debates to bring his -- the answers that he has and the challenges that Joe Biden has to the American people. \u00a0 Without that, Joe Biden can coast. He doesn't need to go to events, and he wins, based on the current polling numbers. So, Trump needs debates.  \u00a0 However, I have faith in the Presidential Commission that they will do the right thing. And the people on that commission put their country ahead of their party. And that's really it. We don't have many people who do that anymore.  \u00a0 Frank Fahrenkopf and the leadership there knows what needs to be done, knows the changes to the debate, moderation that needs to be implemented, so that the American people get a chance to hear from both candidates and just side, side by side, who's better and who's worse.  \u00a0 It would be the worst thing for Donald Trump to allow these debates to get canceled.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, Frank Luntz, we're not there. I should posit that and just raise the possibility, if they're delayed and it gets too close, then they scratch him. We're not there. But we will see. \u00a0 Frank, always good chatting with you, my friend, Frank Luntz following all of that.  \u00a0 We told you at the outset here stocks soaring on the possibility that stimulus could be resumed right now, but there's no way of knowing. \u00a0 What we do know is those Supreme Court confirmation hearings are still very much on for Judge Barrett. What we also know is more than a week ahead of the fact, it's already nasty, very, very nasty.  \u00a0 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Forget about the political storm in Salt Lake City tonight. Have you seen the one that is brewing in the Gulf of Mexico right now?  \u00a0 Because, right now, we're looking at a storm, Hurricane Delta, that could be a Category 4 and hit land as a 5. \u00a0 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, stimulus might still not happen, but those confirmation hearings for Judge Amy Barrett certainly are. \u00a0 Mike Emanuel with the latest on Capitol Hill.  \u00a0 Hey, Mike.  \u00a0 MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Neil, good afternoon. \u00a0 After a slow start, Judge Amy Coney Barrett has spoken today with three Judiciary Committee Democrats, California Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Judiciary Democrat, but no readout was given.  \u00a0 Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse expressed his concerns about undoing the Affordable Care Act and Roe v. Wade. And Delaware Senator Chris Coons spoke by phone with Judge Barrett and says he did not ask her about her membership in religious groups.  \u00a0 Barrett has faced some scrutiny about her Catholic faith and how that might affect her role as a judge. Some Democrats have also questioned her involvement in a small Christian group called People of Praise.  \u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is firing back, saying -- quote -- \"The ongoing attacks by Senate Democrats and the media on Judge Barrett's faith are a disgrace. They demean the confirmation process, disrespect the Constitution, and insult millions of American believers.\" \u00a0 Today, a leading Senate Democrat admitted there's little they can do to stop Barrett's confirmation.  \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 SEN. RICHARD DURBIN (D-IL):\u00a0 Sadly, we're in a spot now, with the number of votes we have, 12 Republicans and 10 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, that, unless there is a change of heart among the Republican senators.  \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 EMANUEL:\u00a0 Some Democrats have called for delaying Barrett's confirmation hearings.  \u00a0 Majority Leader McConnell says the process will go forward.  \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY):\u00a0 There's nothing I can see that would keep that from happening. We can operate successfully in a COVID environment.  \u00a0 Look, you don't shut down a fire department because one of the firemen ended up coming up sick one day. We're going to continue to operate. The American people are entitled to it. And that's what we're going to do.  \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 EMANUEL:\u00a0 Her confirmation is a top priority for both Leader McConnell and, of course, President Trump -- Neil.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, Mike, thank you very, very much.  \u00a0 And, finally, what appears to be justice long in coming for those charged with beheading at least four Americans during the ISIS rampage of the Middle East, two British ISIS suspects making their first court appearance in Virginia.  \u00a0 Gillian Turner has more -- Gillian. \u00a0 GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Hi, Neil.  \u00a0 So, two of the most dangerous and deranged ISIS terrorists alive today have now arrived on U.S. soil. They are facing multiple charges, including hostage-taking resulting in death. The two men have been transferred from military custody into the U.S. criminal justice system. \u00a0 And, this hour, they are appearing in court in Alexandria, Virginia.  \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 JOHN DEMERS, U.S. ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR NATIONAL SECURITY:\u00a0  Today's announcement is a reminder of the threat that we continue to face from radical Islamic terrorism. These terrorists despise the freedoms and the way of life we cherish and are hell-bent on imposing their ideologies on a world that continues to reject them.  \u00a0 If you have American blood in your veins, or you have American blood on your hands, you will face American justice.  \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 TURNER:\u00a0 The two men, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, are part of a group dubbed The Beatles by former hostages because they are British. \u00a0 Now, they have been in U.S. military custody inside Iraq since 2018, where they were involved in kidnapping and killing 27 people, among them, U.S.  aid worker Kayla Mueller, who was kidnapped and then tortured before her death in captivity in 2015, Peter Kassig, also an American aid worker, as well as journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were all beheaded in gruesome videos streamed online, sparking really outrage and horror across the world.  \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 ZACH TERWILLIGER, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA:\u00a0  Forced witnessing of murders, mock executions, shocks by electric Taser, beatings, amongst other brutal acts.  \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 TURNER:\u00a0 The families of Americans murdered by ISIS have been pushing for a long time for The Beatles to be returned to the United States and face prosecution here, because it's believed they would face longer sentences on trial here than if in done in the U.K.  \u00a0 The other new tidbit we're learning this hour, Neil, is that the vice president has invited Kayla Mueller's parents to attend tonight's debate as one of his guests. They have accepted. They are going to be there, this after they both spoke very movingly during the RNC last month -- Neil. \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Gillian Turner at the Justice Department, thank you very, very much for that.  \u00a0 We're so focused on the big debate tonight, the vice presidential debate, and probably what's going to happen with the control of the White House, but a real struggle going on for control of the United States Senate.  \u00a0 The sands are shifting dramatically. What's at stake and who's at stake in the battle you're not watching that you probably should? \u00a0 After this.  \u00a0 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, to say the Democrats are very, very excited about the prospect, if polls prove right, of winning the White House, they're also eying the United States Senate, where they think they have a very good chance of flipping that body around and running the table.  \u00a0 Jackie DeAngelis has been crunching the numbers in some races to see if that's possible -- Jackie.  \u00a0 JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Hi, Neil.  \u00a0 Well, with the spotlight back on the Trump administration's pandemic response, there's also this fresh uncertainty that you mentioned about the fight for the Senate come Election Day.  \u00a0 Now, right now, the Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage in the Senate. But they are playing defense. It's a harder job here, defending 23 seats, the Democrats defending 12. To get control, the Dems need to flip four seats if the president is reelected, three seats to control if Joe Biden wins.  \u00a0 Now, about nine key Senate races are in play. Let's take a look at the map here. The states that we're watching, Arizona, North Carolina, Colorado, and Maine. They are leaning towards the Democrats, tossups right now in Iowa and Montana.  \u00a0 Now, some polls even show that Lindsey Graham's seat in South Carolina is a tossup too. \u00a0 Let's look at North Carolina, because this is an interesting one. Right now, Republican Thom Tillis is under fire for testing positive for COVID-19 as a member of the president's inner circle. He's trailing in the polls by an average of 5.4 points.  \u00a0 Democrat Cal Cunningham, however, married, but had an affair. We will see how that sits with voters.  \u00a0 In Maine, this is another good one to watch. We're looking at Susan Collins here. We got her there. She's the Republican. She's behind Democrat Sara Gideon by an average of 3.7 points. Collins has a reputation of being a little bit more of a moderate.  \u00a0 There's also the issue of taxes. So I'm going to pivot here, because coronavirus cost states a lot of money. They need to figure out how they're going to raise revenue. So we're watching Illinois really closely, because, in that state, the Constitution calls for a flat tax rate of 4.95 percent.  Voters are being asked to approve an amendment that would make it more progressive.  \u00a0 So ,if you make over a million dollars in that state, it would jump to 7.99 percent. Colorado is also one that's in play. Residential property taxes are limited by the Gallagher Amendment. Voters are going to decide if it should be repealed, and that would mean paying higher rates.  \u00a0 If you're in California, you know very well -- oh, sorry about that -- about Proposition 13 from the '70s. Residential and commercial real estate owners, they pay tax based on what they originally paid for the property, with increases capped at 2 percent.  \u00a0 Now lawmakers want residents to remove the caps for commercial businesses with properties worth over $3 million.  \u00a0 Finally, I want to take a look at Alaska, because this is home to big oil.  And the question there, should these companies be paying more in taxes?  Voters are going to decide that as well -- Neil.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, Jackie, a lot on the table there, Jackie DeAngelis on all of that.  \u00a0 By the way, we're still tracking Hurricane Delta right now. It had a direct hit on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, slowed down a little bit. It's picking up steam again, expected to soon be back to a Category 4 storm, a hurricane watch now in effect in parts of Louisiana. \u00a0 We will be getting an update from the governor there, who has already declared a state of emergency, as has the governor of Alabama. They're not taking any chances on this 25th named storm of the season. \u00a0 We have never seen so many, certainly this early, and the ninth to directly threaten the Gulf.  \u00a0 Stay with us.  \u00a0 (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, we will be monitoring Louisiana Governor Edwards. He's going to be having a briefing on this approaching storm right now, Hurricane Delta, and not bumping around right now, expected to re- strengthen to maybe a Category 4 storm, every possibility it could hit land as a Category 5, as incredible as that seems.  \u00a0 Anyway, Rick Reichmuth has more for us right now and tracking everywhere it is going. \u00a0 Rick, what can you tell us?  \u00a0 RICK REICHMUTH, FOX NEWS CHIEF METEOROLOGIST:\u00a0 Well, I tell you, this active season, we're not done yet, although we are on the downhill slide for the year, which is certainly good news.  \u00a0 A hurricane watch already in effect across Southeastern parts of Texas, all the way across the Louisiana coastline, towards Plaquemines parish, the Mississippi River Delta. \u00a0 And that is for a hurricane that will be making landfall sometime Friday evening is the time frame.  \u00a0 This is a satellite loop. Spent a little bit of time over land, cut right across areas of Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and then exiting the Yucatan Peninsula, back over the water, which is plenty warm, not incredibly warm.  We're not talking about water that is really well above average, but it's plenty warm to sustain a hurricane. \u00a0 You get an idea. This is a future radar, what -- one of our modeling radars is a future of what it thinks that the radar will look like as it moves forward in time, probably getting very well organized again.  \u00a0 And the storm, as it moves into the Gulf, Neil, it's going to become a much larger storm. When it made an impact in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, it was a very small storm, hurricane-force winds only extending at around 30 miles or so from the center of that very small eye. \u00a0 This will likely be a much larger storm. That means the impacts will be felt in across a much broader area, primarily Louisiana, maybe a little bit of Texas, and then in across parts of Minnesota.  \u00a0 This is the water temperature you see, certainly warm enough to sustain a hurricane, even a very major hurricane. But notice it does cool down just a little bit right as you get in towards the coast. So, in that last few hours before it makes landfall, waters may be dropping a little bit. And that could be a bit of a saving grace for us.  \u00a0 A lot of oil platforms out of here. This is where all the industry is and where it's going to be cutting right across probably at least as a Cat 2, Cat 3 storm here, across that area. So we're going to watch that closely.  \u00a0 This is the official track from the National Hurricane Center. They officially right now still are forecasting it to come on shore as a Category 3 storm. Keep in mind, back in August, we had a Category 4 storm hitting almost the exact same area of Louisiana, had huge impacts across the Lake Charles area of Louisiana, this one very close into that same area. \u00a0 Took them a long time -- in fact, a lot of people still trying to recover from that storm, and having another storm come right behind that certainly not good news.  \u00a0 We're going to get a lot of rain out of this primarily across parts of Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi. This will be a faster-moving storm in its forward movement. That is good news. That means it won't have as much time to sit around and rain for so long.  \u00a0 And then, Neil, let me just end. Our typical season, September 10 is the peak. You get the idea here. We are on the downhill slide of this season, which is very good news. We can't get out of this soon enough. Give it a couple more weeks, and, hopefully, we will get things calmed down for the remainder of this year -- Neil.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Hopefully.  \u00a0 Thank you very much, Rick Reichmuth, on all of that.  \u00a0 Meanwhile, back to the debate site in Salt Lake City. We just understand that the vice president has toured the facility, heading back to his hotel.  They are all ready for this debate that is now about four hours away.  \u00a0 Stay with us.  \u00a0 (COMMERCIAL BREAK) \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, is there such a thing as, I don't know, a skinny stimulus bill? \u00a0 Wall Street pouncing on the notion that the president's open to that. But what exactly is that? \u00a0 Chad Pergram, what are you hearing?  \u00a0 CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT:\u00a0 Well, it's remarkable that they reengaged today. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the secretary of the Treasury had another phone call today, after President Trump put the kibosh on these talks yesterday. \u00a0 That really underscores just how dire the situation is. And Democrats are more than happy to pin this on the president. He's the one who withdrew from these negotiations.  \u00a0 Here's the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.  \u00a0 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 PELOSI:\u00a0 I think it's a missed opportunity. You should ask them why they don't want to put food on the table, rent in the pockets of the American people, crush the virus, support our heroes and the rest.  \u00a0 We -- our bill is scientifically, institutionally, academically documented to meet the needs of the American people.  \u00a0 (END VIDEO CLIP) \u00a0 PERGRAM:\u00a0 There's been some chatter about doing some stand-alone bills for the airlines or even re-upping extra unemployment benefits.  \u00a0 Pelosi has rejected most stand-alone bills. There is no agreement here.  \u00a0 Now, keep in mind that this negotiation has not really moved at all since May. They reengaged in October because it was a dire situation. All these layoffs were starting to filter in here. The election will be the deciding factor in this.  \u00a0 Also, Neil, we have a bit of breaking news at this hour. Amy Coney Barrett is on Capitol Hill right now. She is touring the hearing room where her confirmation hearing will start next Monday -- Neil.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 All right, Chad, I think you're going to be live-tweeting through all of this tonight, right, the big debate? \u00a0 PERGRAM:\u00a0 That's right, live-blogging alongside Chris Stirewalt. \u00a0 To -- go to the bottom of your screen there. There's a Q.R. code you can scan. You can ask us questions. We will make observations, even discuss debate history and trivia. And come join the fun. It'll be an interesting discussion.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Look forward to it, my friend.  \u00a0 Thank you very, very much. \u00a0 Chad was getting onto this idea that maybe, maybe some targeted COVID relief is coming. That's better than nothing.  \u00a0 There's a group on Capitol Hill trying to get stuff done. They're called the Problem Solvers. It's a caucus of 50 congress men and women, 25 Republicans, 25 Democrats. You can imagine a good many of them in both parties were startled when the president essentially tweeted out, that's it, talks are done, kaput. \u00a0 Josh Gottheimer joins us right now, New Jersey Democratic congressman, Tom Reed, Republican. They are the caucus co-chairs of this House Problem Solvers group.  \u00a0 Gentlemen, welcome to both of you.  \u00a0 I will begin with you, Congressman Gottheimer, on whether this is better than nothing, the idea that the president might entertain, I don't know if they call it a skinny virus relief bill, but one that might include pandemic relief checks for folks or rescue the airline industry, leave it at that for now.  \u00a0 How do you feel about that?  \u00a0 REP. JOSH GOTTHEIMER (D-NJ):\u00a0 Well, I think you really need to take this on as a -- on a comprehensive approach. Doing this thing piecemeal is very difficult.  \u00a0 You risk leaving a lot of people out. We have got small businesses hurting, small towns hurting, a lot of families who really need help. So, I think the way this has come together and the way we get it done is by bringing these pieces together. \u00a0 And we're so close. I think we have got to get back to the table. It's what Tom and I have been pushing for, as well as the Problem Solvers Caucus, for people to reengage. We need the administration to come back. We will all sit back together.  \u00a0 And I think the key is just to get this done. You have got far too many people hurting right now.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Congressman Reed, were you surprised, was it a little lightning bolt out of the blue, when the president said, that's it, it's over, done, this waits until after the election? \u00a0 REP. TOM REED (R-NY):\u00a0 Well, I have been hearing a lot of positive information being exchanged.  \u00a0 We have been working, Josh and I, in the Problem Solvers Caucus for months, eight weeks now. And, really, we're happy that the negotiators were back in the room. And we were hearing positive indications from our sources at the White House and in the Senate and the House that they were getting closer.  \u00a0 The bottom line is, I think there may have been some miscommunication here too, Neil. That is what I'm hearing. Some of the folks in the Senate that I talk to, senators themselves, were under the impression this was a $2.2 trillion offer that Pelosi put down as her last and best offer.  \u00a0 And, really, I think that what may be on the table is a $1.7 trillion deal.  And, from my perspective, if we're talking about a 1.7, our Problem Solvers Caucus deal was at 1.5. And I will tell you, when we talked about that today with some senators, they're like, if that's where the deal is at, there seems to be an appetite to embrace it, to get this done.  \u00a0 And so I hope that these folks get back in the room, the speaker, the president, as well as Mitch McConnell and the senators, get into the room to clarify any miscommunication and put their last, best offers on the table, because they really -- I think they're really close in that final package.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Wow. I didn't know they were that close. \u00a0 Congressman Gottheimer, assuming he's right -- and you're both smart gentlemen, so I'm sure you think he is right. I'm wondering if, you know, for $200 billion, and that close, that a deal could still be had. It could be a deal closer to what we were hearing originally considered, pandemic relief, unemployment relief that would renew again -- I guess it depends whether it's $300, $400, or the old $600 -- but that an all coronavirus relief measure, fairly sweeping, could still be had. \u00a0 Do you agree with that?  \u00a0 GOTTHEIMER:\u00a0 Yes, I think we're -- what I understand -- and I agree with Tom -- is that we're actually very close. \u00a0 And all the parties, the secretary of Treasury, and the White -- and, of course, the speaker were in the room, really, really close to getting there, and not wanting to quit on the American people.  \u00a0 And what's really important, Neil, as you know, is less about the top-line number, and more what's in the number, what programs we're doing. We're doing -- how are we helping people with stimulus checks, and PPE, and helping people with unemployment, and standing by our restaurants and our airline workers. \u00a0 We have got a lot of people hurting. We have got to make sure we have got that testing lined up, especially as we head into flu season. So, the key is what's in there.  \u00a0 And I think, as Tom points out, what often happens is, people are speaking past each other. It's really important that we get everyone back into the room. It's what the Problem Solvers Caucus was so focused on, was getting people, here's a framework for how we start -- restart negotiations.  \u00a0 And we just can't walk away. And the idea that we would wait months now to help people is unconscionable. It's unacceptable. So, let's get people back into the room.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 You know what's inspiring about both of you guys -- I'm sure you have been told this before -- the whole point of the Problem Solvers Caucus, 50 men and women-strong, evenly divided, Republicans, Democrats, is that you can get stuff done.  \u00a0 So you put the extreme nonsense out, and you try to cobble together something that would be mutually acceptable. It's a concept. We used to do this all the time. But now you have to have a caucus to hearken back to that.  \u00a0 Do you think, after this election, regardless of who wins, we can return to that kind of stuff? \u00a0 I will begin with you on this, Congressman Reed.  \u00a0 REED:\u00a0 I absolutely agree with you, Neil.  \u00a0 We need to get back to that and be proud Republicans and proud Democrats, like I know Josh is and the members of the Problem Solvers Caucus on the other -- but -- other side of the aisle -- but respect each other, listen to each other, work with each other, because, at the end of the day, we shouldn't always be about who's going to win the political battle, but how do we work together to win for the American people? \u00a0 And that's what we're all about in the Problem Solvers Caucus. And when Josh and I have a disagreement, we work it out. We stay in the room to find out, where are we coming from? Listen to each other, respect each other, trust each other, so that you don't miscommunicate, and you find that common ground that you can agree upon.  \u00a0 And that's why this deal right now, this COVID-19 deal, I'm not giving up on it. I know Josh isn't giving up on it. We're very close. And they just need to get back in the room and finish this off for the American people.  \u00a0 GOTTHEIMER:\u00a0 And, Neil, I think just adding to that... \u00a0 (CROSSTALK) \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 ... Congressman Gottheimer? \u00a0 GOTTHEIMER:\u00a0 No, you were just spot on about putting country first. \u00a0 I think we spend too much time screaming and yelling, and not enough time actually working together. I think the country wants more civility. They want us to actually get things done. You're not always going to get everything you want.  \u00a0 But the key is to keep moving the country forward. And with what we're facing with this COVID crisis and the economic crisis and the health crisis, we have got to stay in the room and get it done.  \u00a0 CAVUTO:\u00a0 Gentlemen, you lift my spirits that hope springs eternal that two sides can talk to one another, disagree, but you don't have to be disagreeable. You don't have to take cheap shots.  \u00a0 I wish you well. I'm sure you will cobble together something.  \u00a0 I think it was John Kennedy who once said that, at our core, we're human beings. We all breathe the same air. So, let's keep that in mind. Hope springs eternal.  \u00a0 And let's hope we keep to that tonight in the vice presidential debate.  \u00a0 We will be following it on FOX Business beginning at 8:00 p.m., right through and after the debate, looking at market reaction, foreign and here.

        "text": "Games\nGeorgia Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler joins 'Fox &amp; Friends' ahead of her runoff election against Democratic candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock. Both Republican Georgia senators endorsed President Trump's push for $2,000 coronavirus stimulus checks, with\u00a0Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,\u00a0looking to stall the Senate until it votes on the bigger\u00a0payments. Sanders, though, reportedly has an ulterior motive in keeping Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue\u00a0occupied in the days before their respective runoff elections. The Senate is looking to override President Trump's veto of a defense spending bill, but Sanders said he will filibuster this until they vote on whether to increase the relief payments from $600 to $2,000. The House has already agreed to do so. GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFF ENTERS FINAL SPRINT 1 WEEK FROM ELECTION, CAMPAIGNS BRING OUT THE BIG GUNS \"McConnell and the Senate want to expedite the override vote and I understand that,\" Sanders told Politico. \"But I'm not going to allow that to happen unless there is a vote, no matter how long that takes, on the $2,000 direct payment.\" By filibustering and stalling the process, Sanders could theoretically keep the Senate in Washington, D.C., during the holiday week leading to New Year's Day, which would prevent Loeffler and\u00a0Perdue from campaigning in their home states before the\u00a0Jan.\u00a05 elections. The results of those contests will determine which party controls a majority of the Senate heading into President-elect Joe Biden's administration. According to Politico, a \"source close to Sanders\" said that throwing a wrench into the Georgians' campaigns was part of Sanders'\u00a0plan all along. This way, Loeffler and Perdue are stuck in D.C. and eyes will be on them days before the elections as they decide how to vote on the $2,000 payments. Their respective Democratic opponents,\u00a0Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, are in favor of the\u00a0payments. But Loeffler and Perdue both said Tuesday that they support bigger checks, with Perdue telling \"America's Newsroom\" he is \"delighted\" to side with Trump. \"I think with the vaccine coming, I think this is\u00a0absolutely appropriate, so I fully support what the president's doing right now,\" he said. \"I agree with @realDonaldTrump,\" Loeffer tweeted\u00a0after indicating her support on \"Fox & Friends.\" So far there has been a degree of bipartisan support for raising the payment amount from $600 to $2,000. Besides Trump, who made it an issue after both parties had already agreed to $600, dozens of GOP House members voted for it, and Senate Republicans such as Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., have backed the measure. Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich agreed that Senate Republicans should vote for the higher payments and move on, given the dire situation many Americans are facing as the economy continues to recover and reopen following the pandemic-inspired shutdown earlier this year. \"My advice would be to vote for it,\" Gingrich said in a message to Loeffler and Perdue on \"Fox & Friends\" Tuesday morning. He said that the payment amount is just one issue and will not by itself determine the outcome of their races. OUTSIDE GROUPS CONVERGE ON GEORGIA WITH BUS TOURS, ON-THE-GROUND VOLUNTEERS WITH SENATE ON THE LINE Gingrich also said\u00a0this is not the time to worry about controlling government spending. \"This is not about deficit spending. That train has long gone,\" he said. \"We\u2019re in the middle of a disaster. I think the average American deserves some help --\u00a0the very rich have done obscenely well, rising price stock values, etc., the public employee unions have done absurdly well not going to work while collecting full paychecks[.]\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Gingrich also stated that it would generally not be wise for the Republican senators to oppose Trump. \"I think the president's pretty good intuitively at this stuff, has figured out a winning formula, and I would just say to the average Republican, when a big enough train comes through, it's just as well for you not to throw yourself on the tracks and get run over,\" he said.

Tom Cotton\u2019s American Rescue Plan amendment barring convicted killers from collecting COVID-19 stimulus payments. Fox News reached out to all 50 Democratic senatorial offices asking if the senators regretted voting down the Republican's amendment after the Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev received a federal stimulus payment. Only two senators\u2019 offices, those of Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, responded to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.

Cortez Masto supports Treasury\u2019s decision to allow states to seize any economic impact payments that went to violent criminals like Tsarnaev for victim restitution, including payments approved by the Republican Senate majority in 2020,\" Josh Marcus-Blank, the Nevada senator\u2019s spokesman, told Fox News. Cotton put the Senate Democrats on full blast over the Tsarnaev controversy in a Friday email to Fox News, saying there was \"no excuse\" for their vote against his amendment. \"Every single Senate Democrat voted to send COVID relief payments to prisoners, including terrorists and mass murderers like the Boston Bomber, who received a check last year,\" Cotton said. \"Democrats had the chance to do the right thing and vote against sending those checks. But they didn\u2019t. There is no excuse for that \u2014 and now they\u2019ll face the consequences,\" he continued. Sen.

Tsarnaev and other convicted killers had their paths cleared to pick up the taxpayer-funded paycheck when the Senate Democrats voted down Cotton\u2019s amendment and passed the American Rescue Plan last year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Tsarnaev has been ordered by prosecutors to return a $1,400 COVID-19 relief payment he received last summer along with other money sent to him, according to a court filing Wednesday. The convicted killer so far has only paid $2,202.03 of the more than $101 million in restitution owed to his victims. The filing said the $1,400 in COVID-19 relief money should instead be used as restitution. Tsarnaev was sentenced to death two years after the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, which left three people dead and hundreds hurt. The death sentence was overturned in 2020 after a court ruled that a trial judge erred by excluding some evidence. An appeal to reinstate his death sentence is before the U.S. Supreme Court.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Senate Republicans unveiled their version of a fresh round of coronavirus relief on Monday, as White House negotiators and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are set to meet in the evening to begin negotiations. \u201cSo I hope this strong proposal will occasion a real response. Not partisan cheap shots. Not the predictable, tired, old rhetoric as though these were ordinary times and the nation could afford ordinary politics,\u201d Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in unveiling the HEALS Act. The $1 trillion Republican bill is the alternative to the House\u2019s HEROES act, the $3 trillion relief legislation passed in May. HEALS stands for the package\u2019s focus on Health, Economic Assistance, Liability protection, and Schools. The HEALS Act is more targeted than the CARES act, tailored to an economy that has \u201cone foot in the pandemic and one foot in the recovery,\u201d according to McConnell. The relief legislation includes $105\u00a0billion in school funding, more than the House offered in its proposal, with the goal of retrofitting schools and universities with coronavirus precautions to open for on-campus learning. FISCAL CONSERVATIVES REVOLT OVER PRICETAG OF CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE\u00a0 It also includes a second round of stimulus checks at the same $1200 amount as in the CARES act, along with a \u201csequel\u201d to the Paycheck Protection Program to mitigate layoffs. Federal unemployment benefits would be extended, but at an additional $200 per week rather than the $600 that the CARES Act offered. That number would run through the first week of October, at which point states are supposed to bring a more complicated program online where those who are still unemployed can collect 70 percent of their former wages. \u201cThe boosted unemployment benefit is significantly more than the Democratic Senate and President approved in the 2009 economic crisis, and it doesn\u2019t pay most people more than working like the extra $600 does,\u201d Sen. Finance Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said. McConnell noted that the additional $200 was still eight times the $25 per week in federal benefits offered following the 2008 recession. Liability protections would be included for everyone from doctors and nurses, who will be protected from malpractice suits, to churches, charities, businesses and schools, McConnell noted. The hope is that the protections will encourage companies to reopen without fear that they will spend years in court. The bill also includes $16 billion for COVID-19 testing and contact tracing; $20 billion for vaccine, therapeutic and diagnostic development; $20 billion for farmers and $30 billion to protect the military and defense industrial base from the virus. McConnell delayed unveiling the legislation last week after he said the White House had requested more time to review it. Trump had long pushed for a payroll tax cut to spur hiring, but ultimately Republicans opted for direct stimulus payments instead. The Democratic leader in the Senate, Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, blasted the legislation as \u201ctotally inadequate.\u201d \u201cWe've waited months for a Republican bill and still\u00a0the Republican response is totally inadequate,\u201d the New York Democrat said on the Senate floor. He criticized the Republican plan for offering\u00a0the unemployed 70 percent of their former wages. \u201cRepublicans say take a 30 percent\u00a0pay cut. Can you believe that? You lost your job, can't get to work, and now they want to take $1600 out of your pocket every month,\u201d Schumer said. McConnell urged Democrats to put aside their \u201csocialist manifesto,\u201d the HEROES Act, and come to the negotiating table. \u201cThe Senate will not waste time with pointless partisanship,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a reason why even Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer themselves have publicly downplayed the multi-trillion-dollar socialist manifesto they published some weeks back, and have suggested the real, serious discussion would begin when Republicans released our outline.\u201d \u201cAre we going to get the Democratic Party we got in March, when our colleagues met us in good-faith negotiations and worked with us to turn our framework into a bipartisan product?\u201d McConnell continued.\u201cOr will the country get the Democratic Party we saw in June, when our colleagues refused to suggest amendments or improvements to Senator Tim Scott\u2019s police reform bill, and chose to block the issue altogether?\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He said Democrats\u2019 failure to negotiate with Republicans on police reform left some wondering whether they had chosen to \u201cgive up on bipartisan legislation altogether through November.\u201d Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

        "text": "Games\nPresident Trump signs $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. President Trump on Friday signed a more than $2 trillion legislative package to combat the coronavirus pandemic and send economic relief to workers and businesses squeezed by restrictions meant to stop the outbreak\u2019s spread after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the legislation earlier in the day. \"I want to thank Democrats and Republicans for coming together and putting America first,\" Trump said during an afternoon Oval Office signing ceremony. Trump marveled at the magnitude of the aid package as he penned his name on the legislation:\u00a0\"I've never signed anything with a 'T' on it,\" Trump quipped of the trillions of dollars of new spending. The legislation, approved by voice vote despite 11th-hour drama arising from a GOP lawmaker\u2019s objections, amounts to the costliest stimulus plan in U.S. history. It includes checks for most Americans, boosted unemployment aid, help for small business as well as a massive loan fund for corporations \u2013 at a time when unemployment is surging at a record pace, a consequence of businesses closing in compliance with social distancing guidelines. CORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW \u201cThis bill is not only a rescue package, it is a commitment...that your government and the people whom you\u00a0elected to serve will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face, both now and in the foreseeable future,\u201d House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said prior to the vote.\u00a0\"To the American public:\u00a0If you do your part, I promise we will do ours.\" The approval, while widely anticipated, followed a stretch of uncertainty over whether one congressman -- concerned about the stunning cost of the package -- might be able to stall the vote. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had furiously objected to a simple voice vote that would have required only a minimal number of lawmakers to travel. Massie, as part of his push, wanted to\u00a0ensure there is a quorum, which would require half of the members to show up on Capitol Hill. So as President Trump and others accused him of grandstanding, hundreds of lawmakers were summoned to Washington D.C. Thursday night and Friday morning from coronavirus-ravaged communities in New York, California and elsewhere. This, despite\u00a0strict guidelines from the Capitol physician advising lawmakers\u00a0not to congregate at the Capitol and to stay in their offices until needed\u00a0to avoid the spread of the virus that has already infected several lawmakers. \u201cMassie has now become the most hated person on Capitol Hill,\" said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who left his home at 4:30 a.m. to drive to the Capitol to ensure the measure got passed Friday. While Massie was able to ensure many lawmakers showed up for the vote, he was not, in the end, able to force a roll-call. The House, after several hours of debate, ultimately passed the measure by voice vote, and it was allowed to stand. There were loud cries for \u2018ayes\u2019 and few rumblings of \u2018nos\u2019 on the House floor. \u201cThe ayes have it,\u201d declared the presiding officer, Rep. Anthony Brown, D-Md. But Massie stood up and objected. \u201cI came here to make sure our republic doesn\u2019t die by unanimous consent in an empty chamber and I request a recorded vote,\u201d Massie said. Brown ruled that an insufficient number of lawmakers stood in support of a roll call vote. But Massie pressed on. \u201cI object on the basis that a quorum is not present,\u201d Massie said, instructing a count of lawmakers. \u201cA quorum is present and the motion is adopted,\u201d Brown ruled, to applause. Minutes before the vote, Speaker Nancy Pelosi took to the floor to summon social-distancing lawmakers at the Capitol in an effort to gather quorum and shut down the Massie effort. Pelosi touted the aid forthcoming for\u00a0Americans and small businesses, while acknowledging that more needs\u00a0to be done for state and local governments and the frontline healthcare workers. She paid homage to a nurse manager, Kious\u00a0Kelly, who died from coronavirus after\u00a0serving at a New York City hospital that had to resort to using plastic garbage bags as gowns. \u201cWe know that this cannot be our final bill,\u201d Pelosi said. In a series of speeches prior to the historic rescue bill, lawmakers pressed for national unity despite the bill's imperfections. \u201cWe're going to help Americans through this,\" McCarthy said. \"We're going to do this together and in the end, we are going to be healthier, stronger and more united than ever before, because as Americans, that's who we are.\u201d Upon catching wind of the plan to stop a roll-call vote, though, Massie howled on Twitter over the parliamentary machinations. \"It\u2019s pretty clear now, with enough members here to pass the bill, that Pelosi and McCarthy are still working together to block a recorded vote just to insulate members of Congress from ACCOUNTABILITY. Biggest spending bill in the history of mankind, and no recorded vote? #SWAMP,\" he tweeted. After the voice vote, Massie accused Pelosi and McCarthy of trying to shield their members from the political ramifications. \"There's a big cover up in there,\" Massie said as he exited the Capitol. Emotions ran hot on the House floor all morning Friday before the vote on the $2 trillion stimulus bill. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., started her impassioned floor speech by noting 13 people died in one day at Queen\u2019s Elmhurst Hospital and medical professionals still don\u2019t have enough ventilators and personal protection equipment. She ripped the Senate for fighting for corporate bailouts that will contribute to\u00a0the income inequality gap\u00a0in order for families to get \u201ccrumbs.\u201d \u201cWhat did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful!\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. On the other side of the aisle, Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., said he\u2019s \u201cdistressed by the Hobson\u2019s choice\" lawmakers face of having to\u00a0accept unrelated spending sprees in order to\u00a0send relief. \u201cNo more billion-dollar bailouts for things that are unrelated. No more policies that are long-standing for a short-standing issue that needs our critical attention,\u201d Perry said. In a bizarre and seemingly unnecessary point of drama, Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., refused to stop speaking when her time ran out on the House floor, even though Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., was willing to let her finish if she had just paused to let him officially grant her more time. Instead, Stevens continued yelling and held up her hands \u2013 clad with pink surgical gloves\u2014in an apparent homage to front line healthcare workers fighting the coronavirus pandemic even though her mic was cut. As the presiding officer\u00a0was pounding the gavel and ruling Stevens \u201cout of order,\u201d Stevens screamed, \u201cdo not be afraid!\u201d Republicans, who are trying hard to flip the freshman rep\u2019s seat in November, immediately pounced on the outburst as a \u201cmeltdown.\u201d The bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget. The $2.2 trillion estimate is the White House's best guess of the spending it contains. The legislation would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year and $2,400 to a married couple making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child. Unemployment insurance would be made far more generous, with $600 per week tacked onto regular state jobless payments through the end of July. States and local governments would receive $150 billion in supplemental funding to help them provide basic and emergency services during the crisis. The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed, subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses, states, and municipalities. All would be up to the Treasury Department's discretion, though businesses controlled by Trump or immediate family members and by members of Congress would be ineligible. There was also $150 billion devoted to the health care system, including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads. Frustrations were already hot as lawmakers had to return to Washington in a panic after\u00a0Massie, R-Ky., threatened to upend plans for a simple voice vote with as few lawmakers as possible. \u201cTo you who oppose this bill: Please, please stand down,\" Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., pleaded on the House floor.\u00a0 \"We can't wait another day to help. Don't add to this disruption\u00a0by, in fact, being a disruptor. Be a leader.\" Lawmakers spoke passionately about how COVID-19 is hurting the health of their communities and how the widespread shutdown of the economy is crippling families and businesses. Yet many openly grappled with voting in favor of bill they believe will be helpful, while it\u2019s chock-full of other provisions that they disagree with. \u201cThis is ripping my heart out because there\u2019s things in this bill that just don\u2019t belong there.\u00a0I consider them--,\" Rep. David Schweikert, R-Ariz., said, stopping\u00a0himself midsentence. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t say that word in front of a microphone.\u201d Schweikert, however, argued Congress must \u201cdo the right thing\u201d by passing the legislation. However, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., said he\u00a0opposed the legislation over cost and debt concerns. \"As President Trump said, we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself,\" Buck said.

Georgia\u2019s two senators sent a letter Thursday to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Charles Retting to complain about \u201cglitches\u201d at the tax-collecting agency that have prevented people from receiving their coronavirus-related stimulus checks.  Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, both Republicans, said they have fielded complaints from constituents about \u201cglitches in the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s processes\u201d when people apply for the Economic Impact Payments that were part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed by Congress in March. The Republican lawmakers specifically point to constituents never receiving their money despite being told they were eligible for the payments and having supplied the IRS with direct deposit information. Others have complained that when they try to input their direct deposit information in the \u201cNeed More Information\u201d tool online, they receive an error message. HOUSE PASSES $484B CORONAVIRUS EMERGENCY RELIEF BILL\u00a0 Their constituents \u201care understandably frustrated that there is no viable way to follow up to receive an update on the status of their payment,\u201d the senators wrote in their letter. \u201cWe urge you to take steps to continue to improve your online tool to ensure that eligible individuals can promptly receive their payments or create additional outlets for them to receive information on the status of their payments.\u201d They added: \u201cConsidering today is the extended tax filing deadline, which will bring another wave of inquiries, we expect the IRS to develop an innovative plan to reduce the size of the backlog as soon as possible, since resuming operations at the current pace is unacceptable.\u201d The tax filing deadline was extended from April 15 to July 15 due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. The global public health crisis has wreaked havoc on the United States\u2019 economy \u2013 putting millions of people out of work and throwing financial markets into flux as states continue to struggle with reopening amid a surge of new COVID-19 cases. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The U.S. coronavirus pandemic is now in month five, with infections hitting records in Florida, Texas and California, causing state and local authorities to again shut down parts of their economies.  The trillions of dollars in economic support passed in April to keep Americans and businesses afloat is now mostly running out. Enhanced unemployment benefits expire at the end of the month unless Congress acts, and at this point many consumers are upward of 90 days past due on debts that would be in collections if it wasn\u2019t for government and bank-sponsored forbearance programs.

It is doubtful that the House and Senate could tackle the next COVID-19 package until the first week of March, Fox News has learned. But, the process to put a COVID relief measure on the floors of both the House and Senate begins next week. Here\u2019s the problem: How does the Senate move such a measure (still unwritten) and avoid a filibuster? That requires 60 yeas. Moreover, how do Democrats advance a plan in a 50/50 Senate? The answer is \"budget reconciliation.\" It is an arcane, one-year fiscal process that curbs debate in the Senate to only 20 hours. No filibusters allowed. And it only needs 51 votes to pass. BERNIE SANDERS ON DEMS GETTING LEGISLATION THROUGH WITH FILIBUSTER: 'DAMN RIGHT WE WILL' Fox News has learned that the House Budget Committee will prepare a budget \"vehicle\" on Feb. 1. The measure would likely go to the House floor on Feb. 3. This \"vehicle\" is the essential first step. You can\u2019t do the substance of the coronavirus\u00a0bill unless you have the reconciliation vehicle that allows the Senate to consider the actual package under these special rules. Fox is told the Senate will likely move its budget reconciliation vehicle on Feb. 5. In other words, this is the \"bus\" that will hold contents of the next COVID package -- and allow it to bypass filibusters. SANDERS THREATENS TO ADVANCE CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS WITH RECONCILIATION IF REPUBLICANS REFUSE SUPPORT Fox News is told it will still take a couple of weeks to get the next coronavirus bill together, and that will likely hit the first week of March. But it could go earlier if the measure is ready. Democrats used budget reconciliation to pass ObamaCare in 2010 because they couldn\u2019t get 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. Republicans unsuccessfully used reconciliation to try to do undo ObamaCare. And, Republicans also used reconciliation to approve tax reform.

Most Americans received $1,200 stimulus checks as part of the first relief bill back in April. Fox News' Evie Fordham contributed to this report.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. The federal government began issuing coronavirus relief stimulus payments to individuals and families weeks ago\u00a0but so far millions still have not received checks or direct deposits. Here are several possible explanations for why that could be: HOW TO SPOT A COUNTERFEIT STIMULUS CHECK: SECRET SERVICE, TREASURY WARN AGAINST CORONAVIRUS RELIEF FRAUD You do not qualify Many people simply are not eligible for the money. According to the CARES Act, nonresident immigrants are not eligible for payments, nor are individuals who are claimed as dependents by others. Additionally, the $500 per child bonus payments only apply to children under the age of 17. Additionally, the law says that payments can be offset by\u00a0any past due child support payments that have been reported to the Treasury Department. Another reason why someone may not be eligible is they earned too much money. Individuals who earned more than $75,000, joint filers who earned more than a combined $150,000, and those filing as heads of household who earned more than $112,000 will have their payments reduced by\u00a0$5 for every $100 in income above those marks.\u00a0This means the payment is less the higher\u00a0earnings are, with it being reduced to zero for individuals\u00a0who make $99,000 or more and couples who make $198,000 or more. Delays from tax-prep services A common reason why payments are delayed is the applicant used tax-preparation services to file their taxes. Those services set up temporary accounts for some customers to receive tax refund payments from the IRS so they can deduct fees before passing the remainder along to the recipients. According to a ProPublica report, banks where those temporary accounts are located have been getting people's stimulus checks and returning them to the IRS, claiming they received them in error. IRS has incorrect bank information In other cases, the IRS may not have a person's up-to-date banking information if a person has changed bank accounts since they last filed taxes. This would impact their ability to send direct deposits to the proper location. The IRS has a Get My Payment tool on its website to assist people in updating their banking information. You filed a paper tax return Payment amounts are determined in most cases by income as reported in people's tax returns. According to the IRS, they are currently unable to process paper returns due to COVID-19. As a result, those who have already filed paper returns will have to wait until processing centers reopen to have their returns handled. The IRS advises that people do not file a second return electronically. You normally get paper checks for tax refunds If you typically opt to receive tax refunds via check in the mail as opposed to electronic direct deposit, then it is likely that your stimulus check will be sent via paper check as well, which takes longer. Wrong amount In some cases, people received payments, just not for the correct amount. For example, the IRS has recognized that there are Americans who did not receive their bonus payments of $500 per child. While they have not explained why this has happened, the government says that in these cases, people can claim the additional money when they file their 2020 tax returns. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Additional information on how the stimulus checks work can be found here. The stimulus checks are part of a massive relief effort totaling nearly $3 trillion to date, covering everything from loans and grants to businesses to local government support. Fiscal concerns over the degree and pace of spending gained traction following\u00a0a Congressional Budget Office report, released in late April, which projected a federal budget deficit of $3.7 trillion for the 2020 fiscal year. The report also said that by the end of fiscal 2020, publicly held federal debt could\u00a0be 101 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. The total national debt is currently nearing $25 trillion.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., released on\u00a0Thursday his proposal for a massive stimulus package that Republicans drafted to ease the financial strains on Americans due to the economic fallout from the\u00a0coronavirus pandemic. The package, which\u00a0costs upwards of $1 trillion and focus on \u201cdirect financial help\u201d to Americans in the form of cash payments, is not a done deal as McConnell will still need to get Democrats -- and a few lingering Republicans -- on board, but his bill outlined a series of measures they hope to see\u00a0included in the final draft of the\u00a0bill, with the biggest one likely being a series of stimulus checks sent out to most Americans. \u201cSenate Republicans want to put cash in the hands of the American people,\u201d McConnell said Thursday, noting that lawmakers are currently finalizing a structure that can quickly send assistance to Americans. MCCONNELL'S CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PLAN WOULD PROVIDE PAYMENTS OF $1,200 PER PERSON, $2,400 FOR COUPLES McConnell indicated job status would not be a factor, and that the money would go to unemployed workers and those recently laid off; those\u00a0still working; and retirees, even if they're already receiving Social Security checks. While officials have indicated the ultra-rich would not be eligible, McConnell said Thursday the checks would still go to everybody \"from the middle class on down. Period.\" What options are being floated? McConnell\u2019s proposal would provide as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per couple in the U.S. The draft legislation, obtained by Fox News, would provide minimum payments of $600, and aid would be phased down at income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. Additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. Republicans are also pushing for relief and support for small businesses, and would provide \u201cnew federally guaranteed loans\u201d that he said would \u201caddress immediate cash flow problems.\u201d McConnell said that the Senate was working to let \u201cqualified\u201d small businesses get liquidity through \u201cfamiliar institutions\u201d like their community banks. Another facet that the GOP\u00a0included in the package is\u00a0implementing \u201ctargeted lending\u201d to industries of national importance, like the airline industry. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about so-called bailouts for firms that made reckless decisions,\u201d McConnell said, referencing the 2008 financial crisis. \u201cNo one is alleging a moral hazard here.\u201d \u201cNone of these firms, not corner stores, pizza parlors, not airlines, brought this on themselves,\"\u00a0he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about a taxpayer-funded cushion for companies that made mistakes. We\u2019re talking about loans that must be repaid.\u201d MNUCHIN SAYS WH LOOKING TO SEND $1,000 CHECKS TO MOST AMERICANS WITHIN 3 WEEKS\u00a0 Democratic leadership in the Senate seems to be mostly on the same page with their Republican colleagues, with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., saying his party is \u201cready and eager to look at what Republicans put together and to work with them to put together a bipartisan project.\u201d Democrats agree with Republicans on issues like helping small businesses and making sure American workers receive money during the crisis. One concern Democrats do have, however, is that any lending to at-risk industries must include protections for workers\u2019 jobs. There has been widespread criticism of the airline industry for its recent stock buyouts using money that could help the ailing sector during the current pandemic. \u201c[I]f there is going to be a bailout of any sort for industry, worker priorities and worker protections must be included,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. \u201cCorporations should not get a bailout and then be allowed to fire employees or cut their salaries, cut their benefits. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Schumer also wants a \u201cMarshall Plan\u201d for the country\u2019s public health infrastructure -- a reference to the massive initiative to help Europe rebuild after World War II. The lack of preparedness and dearth of medical supplies in the U.S. has come under intense scrutiny since the outbreak of the coronavirus reached American shores. \u201cWithout a massive commitment from this Congress, our health care system will not be able to handle this crisis,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThere are not enough workers, not enough supplies, not enough beds, not enough state and local funding. There is a major concern that as this virus spreads that countless Americans will not be able to access or afford treatment if they get the coronavirus.\u201d Democrats also want to step up the money given to working Americans who are unemployed because of the current crisis, with Schumer calling it \u201cunemployment insurance on steroids.\u201d \u201cOur new employment insurance -- an unemployment insurance on steroids -- must have full payment so lost salaries are totally made up for, it must be quick and easy to access, and it must be broad-based,\" Schumer said. \u201cDemocrats will ask for that as one of our most important asks because that goes to the people who need help.\u201d Fox News\u2019 Gregg Re, Brooke Singman and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

Some Democrats are demanding that stimulus payments as part of the coronavirus response include illegal\u00a0immigrants -- part of an ongoing effort to eliminate all barriers to public assistance for those in the country without documentation. The $2 trillion stimulus package passed by\u00a0Congress and signed into law by President Trump gives small business loans and assistance to individuals in the form of direct payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child. The latter is distributed to those with Social Security numbers. CLICK FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK While that includes working legal immigrants -- like those\u00a0here on nonimmigrant (temporary) work visas -- who have Social Security numbers in order to be able to work legally in the U.S., it does not include those who are here illegally. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for a Social Security number, so they either do not pay income taxes or they file taxes via an Individual Taxpayer Identity Number (ITIN). The IRS describes\u00a0\"a tax processing number only available for certain nonresident and resident aliens, their spouses, and dependents who cannot get a Social Security Number.\" This includes illegal immigrants. Democratic lawmakers have seized on that distinction to claim that \u201chardworking immigrants\u201d will be left out of the payments -- although working legal immigrants will not be. Rep.\u00a0 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who has called for \"Medicare-for-all\" programs that would include health care for illegal immigrants, has also complained about the limiting of benefits to those with Social Security numbers. Some in Congress are making moves to expand benefits to include ITIN holders. AOC BLASTS CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS, BLAMES GOP FOR NOT GRANTING CHECKS TO ALL IMMIGRANTS \u201cI was appalled to learn hardworking, taxpaying immigrants were left out of the $2 trillion CARES Act. These taxpayers work in critical sectors of our economy, like agriculture, and contribute greatly to our country. While many of us sit at home, these hardworking immigrants are still at work in our hospitals, our fields, and countless other industries,\u201d Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., said in a statement. Correa and other Democrats have proposed the Leave No Taxpayer Behind Act, which would specifically include ITIN holders. Other members have sought different methods but with the same goal -- getting stimulus money into the hands of illegal immigrants as fast as possible. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., has proposed the Automatic BOOST to Communities Act, which would give debit cards preloaded with $2,000 to \u201cevery person in America.\u201d That would include \u201cnon-citizens, including undocumented people, permanent residents, and temporary visitors whose stay exceeds three months.\u201d Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., captured these concerns\u00a0when she crossed out the words \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d in a New York Post story, and replaced it with \u201cAmerican taxpayers.\u201d\u00a0  \u201cThere, fixed it for you,\u201d she tweeted. That message is being echoed in liberal states as well, where action specifically to help those who illegally entered the United States is underway. California Gov.

However, there is an effort to tuck a provision in the bill for another round of direct payments.\u00a0 In\u00a0New York City,\u00a0Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was \"really unhappy\" on Thursday with the stimulus package being negotiated in Congress, saying it was not acceptable that the deal was unlikely to include state and local aid. \"What do we see right now in Washington?\" de Blasio asked.\u00a0\"Endless discussion that now is leaving out all state and local aid, that means that city government, state government will not be able to get back on our feet and serve our people -- it just doesn\u2019t make any sense.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,\u00a0said Wednesday that \"We're still talking and I think we're going to get there.\" On Thursday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., seemed to agree. \"We're very close to an agreement, but the details really matter when it comes to unemployment benefits, stimulus checks, aid to small businesses and so much else.\" But\u00a0de Blasio\u00a0said\u00a0that sidelining local government aid means there will be no proper recovery in places like New York.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I don\u2019t find this package acceptable, it\u2019s not going to get us where we need to go,\" he said. Although, he said direct payments were a step in the right direction.

No relief, no direct relief for working families. We've got to make sure working people get relief. They ought to be top priority.\" Fox News'\u00a0Adam Shaw\u00a0contributed to this report.

        "text": "Games\nFOX News media analyst and 'Media Buzz' host Howard Kurtz has the details on 'Special Report' Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is criticizing President-elect Biden's new coronavirus relief, arguing that it doesn't go far enough to help people in need during the pandemic. Biden's stimulus plan, which includes the increased payments, would cost $1.9 trillion. According to The Washington Post, most people would end up with a total of $2,000 in stimulus, including\u00a0$600 checks dispensed in recent legislation. But that wasn't enough for Ocasio-Cortez, who appeared to want the latest checks to reach $2,000 as she and others have repeatedly requested. \"$2,000 means $2,000. $2,000 does not mean $1,400,\u2033 she told the Post. Biden pledged before the Georgia runoffs this month that a Democratic Senate would pass $2,000 stimulus checks. AOC SUGGESTION OF COMMISSION TO 'REIN IN' MEDIA SLAMMED AS 'WHOLLY UN-AMERICAN' CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In a follow up tweet, Ocasio-Cortez argued that Congress should proivde retroactive unemployment relief, in addition to the $400 per week that Biden included in his latest proposal. Biden's proposal also expanded from $500 to $1,500 the Earned Income Tax Credit. With Democrats controlling both chambers and the White House after November's elections, it appeared more likely they could pass a stimulus package. Sam Dorman is a reporter with Fox News.

        "text": "Games\nThe $2.2 trillion coronavirus economic stimulus bill gains more than the 60 votes needed to pass the U.S. Senate; congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. On the\u00a0day\u00a0the Senate was set to vote on the\u00a0CARES Act,\u00a0a few of my colleagues\u00a0and I\u00a0found out that the bill did not cap Unemployment Insurance benefits at the employee\u2019s previous salary, which we believed to be a drafting error. This means that workers could make more money by not working than they would make if they had a job.\u00a0Surely\u00a0no responsible adult or elected official would favor such a government program creating a perverse disincentive to return to work when it\u2019s safe to do so and we start re-opening our economy. Whether your local economy starts opening up next week, next month or three months from now, we should not have ANY policies in place that harm or slow our economic recovery. PENCE, VAN DAHLEN & VAN WINKLE: DURING CORONAVIRUS CRISIS, WE MUST ALSO FOCUS ON OUR MENTAL HEALTH Sens. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Tim Scott, R-S.C., and I offered an amendment to fix this mistake, but it quickly became apparent that the \u201cdrafting error\u201d was an intentional policy negotiated by Senate Democrats, who then proceeded to vote down our amendment. So\u00a048 U.S. senators voted for a government program that incentivizes people to not work, and no one batted an eye. And don\u2019t blame or judge the workers. After all, what would you do if you were struggling to make ends meet, to pay rent, to provide for your loved ones? Before the vote and as we were debating our amendment on the Senate floor, one comment from Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, of Illinois, stood out to me. He said, \u201cif we err on the side of giving a hard-working family an extra thousand dollars or two thousand dollars because of our approach, so be it.\u201d Now let me be clear: I support policies \u2013 like boosting unemployment insurance, loans to\u00a0affected small businesses, and significant funding for our health care workers, testing and other programs to address the spread of the virus \u2013 that will help our country get through this\u00a0unprecedented\u00a0crisis. I also proposed a full moratorium on financial transactions, including rent, mortgages, credit card payments, student\u00a0loans and taxes, to help American families that are struggling. None of my Democrat colleagues\u00a0could muster the courage to support that proposal. But Durbin\u2019s comments raise what to me is an alarming question: why do we HAVE to err? Why is the assumption that government will always be inefficient and wasteful? And where, besides Washington, do people just shrug at the notion that hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars could be wasted or be used to disadvantage our economic recovery? The political class in Washington scoffs when people like me say that government needs to be run like a business.\u00a0They say government\u2019s too complicated to run like a business.\u00a0Any elected official or government bureaucrat who believes that should resign tomorrow, because they are part of the problem.\u00a0 Most families in this country survive by not being wasteful, but by clipping coupons, by buying necessities when they are on sale, by cutting their own grass and by reusing aluminum foil. While\u00a0much\u00a0of the funding in the\u00a0CARES Act\u00a0was necessary and will help those struggling during this crisis,\u00a0unfortunately,\u00a0many\u00a0programs\u00a0are\u00a0riddled\u00a0with waste,\u00a0inefficiency and potential fraud. These federal programs are \u201cerring\u201d a lot, and\u00a0many of\u00a0the beneficiaries aren\u2019t hard-working families. It\u2019s big businesses, well-connected industries, wealthy property owners and, in some cases, dead people. More than 70 publicly traded companies have received taxpayer-funded loans (that can be forgiven) through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which was meant to support small businesses that are suffering. Nothing in the bill required businesses to prove that they are suffering financial harm from this crisis. Beneficiaries include Ruth\u2019s Chris Steakhouse, Shake Shack (which decided to return their loan after a public outcry) and Hallador Energy Co. You know what small businesses didn\u2019t get a loan under the PPP? Your local coffee shop, florist, hairdresser or mom-and-pop hardware store. After the well-connected businesses with long-standing financial relationships with the banks got their forgivable loans, the program ran out of money. The people this program was meant to help are getting left out in the cold because negotiators said we need to get this money out fast. They\u2019ve admitted that taxpayer money will be wasted, but that\u2019s just the price you pay. It\u2019s the cost of doing business. Only in Washington. But that\u2019s not all! Stimulus checks are\u00a0being sent to dead people. That\u2019s not a joke.\u00a0On top of sending checks to people who haven\u2019t lost their job and are still receiving a paycheck, the Treasury Department has sent $1,200\u00a0checks\u00a0to people who are deceased.\u00a0They have no intention of trying to get that money back. The bill also included grant programs that allow private universities like Harvard, with its $40 billion endowment, to receive $9 million in taxpayer money. And of course, $25 million for the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The political class in Washington scoffs when people like me say that government needs to be run like a business.\u00a0They say government\u2019s too complicated to run like a business.\u00a0Any elected official or government bureaucrat who believes that should resign tomorrow, because they are part of the problem.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0said on Thursday that next week she will force lawmakers to take a recorded vote on $2,000 stimulus checks for Americans after President Trump demanded such checks and House Republicans blocked Democrats from bringing a unanimous consent request to make that happen. At the same time, Democrats blocked the GOP from bringing a unanimous consent request aimed at addressing the other part of Trump's twofold grievances about the massive coronavirus stimulus and government funding package lawmakers sent to his desk \u2013\u00a0foreign aid. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., meanwhile, slammed the president in a press conference, accusing him of backtracking on the understanding that he would sign the legislation to fund the government for the next year while providing Americans with $600 stimulus checks and dispatching other coronavirus aid. \"The deal that we made was a deal that we thought was appropriate in the sense that it had the votes to pass,\" Hoyer said on a\u00a0busy Christmas Eve in Washington, D.C. \"And, according to Republican leaders that I have talked to, had the representation from both Secretary Mnuchin and the president of the United States that he would sign the bill.\" HOUSE GOP, DEMS STYMIE REQUESTS TO RECONSIDER STIMULUS, SPENDING PACKAGE AFTER TRUMP'S GRIEVANCES Hoyer added: \"He has still said he won't sign the bill, and I urge him and hope that he will sign the bill.\" The longtime legislator from Maryland then turned to lambaste the president for not speaking up earlier on his request for larger stimulus checks. \"Republicans had rejected proposals for higher stimulus checks in the bill that we passed and previous bills,\" Hoyer said. \"Last week as I said we reached a bipartisan agreement. We sent the bill to President Trump to sign. And only then, after we agreed on a figure we thought was too low for direct payments to families and children... did the president of the United States indicate that $600 was not enough.\" Still, Hoyer demanded that Trump \"sign this bill now\" to keep the government running and deliver other coronavirus-related aid. Added Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., at the same press conference as Hoyer: \"The president doesn\u2019t give a damn about people ... he threw kerosene on a terror\u00a0fire.\" TRUMP OPPOSITION TO CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL THREATENS TO DERAIL ECONOMIC RECOVERY House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.,\u00a0said in a Wednesday night letter that House Democrats \"have conveniently ignored the concerns expressed by the president, and shared by our constituents, that we ought to reexamine how our tax dollars are spent overseas while so many of our neighbors at home are struggling to make ends meet.\" Pelosi, in a statement Thursday, indicated that next week she'll put legislation for $2,000 checks for a recorded vote in the House, forcing GOP members to go on the record on whether or not they agree with the president's demand. \"Today, on Christmas Eve morning, House Republicans cruelly deprived the American people of the $2,000 that the president agreed to support,\" she said. \"On Monday, I will bring the House back to session, where we will hold a recorded vote on our stand-alone bill to increase economic impact payments to $2,000.\u00a0To vote against this bill is to deny the financial hardship that families face and to deny them the relief they need.\" After members of both parties Monday touted the accord they had reached and passed on both government spending and coronavirus aid, Trump tipped off the scramble that led to unusual floor action on Christmas Eve with a scathing video slamming the legislation. \"I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000, or $4,000 for a couple,\" Trump said in a\u00a0Twitter video.\u00a0\"I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation, and to send me a suitable bill or else the next administration will have to deliver a package, and maybe that administration will be me.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He added: \"A few months ago, Congress started negotiations on a new package to get urgently needed help to the American people. It's taken forever...\u00a0However, the bill they are now planning to send back to my desk is much different than anticipated. It really is a disgrace.\" The fight between Trump and lawmakers also risks another government shutdown Monday night as the government is currently operating on an interim, one-week bill. There are also a bevy of coronavirus-related aid provisions that will expire before the new year if lawmakers and the president don't act. Pelosi on Monday is also set to have the House consider an extension on the interim funding package that will keep the government's lights on until the new year.\u00a0 Fox News' Jason Donner contributed to this report.\u00a0 Tyler Olson is a Capitol Hill Producer for Fox News in Washington, D.C.

        "text": "Games\nMore than a million stimulus payments totaling\u00a0nearly\u00a0$1.4 billion went to dead people after the Treasury Department and IRS, as they sought to get\u00a0cash out as quickly as possible, neglected to use death records to prevent payments going to the deceased, according to a new watchdog\u00a0report. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, which looked at how the nearly $3 trillion stimulus package was administered, said that the IRS typically uses third-party data such as death records maintained by the Social Security Administration to prevent erroneous tax refund claims. TRUMP HINTS AT 'GENEROUS' SECOND CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS CHECK. HERE'S HOW MUCH YOU COULD\u00a0GET The CARES Act, passed by Congress and signed by President Trump at the end of March, provided $1,200 to adults and $500 for children to help reinvigorate the economy after it was largely shuttered in response to the coronavirus crisis. Payments were distributed based on either a 2018 or 2019 tax return, and total payments added up to $269 billion. But with the economic stimulus checks sent out\u00a0in April and May in response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Treasury and IRS \u201cdid not use the death records to stop payments to deceased individuals for the first three batches of payments because of the legal interpretation under which IRS was operating.\u201d IRS counsel reportedly \u201cdetermined that IRS did not have the legal authority to deny payments to those who filed a return for 2019, even if they were deceased at the time of payment.\u201d It also advised \u201cdiscretion\u201d provided for in the CARES Act (which authorized the payments) to apply the same set of rules to those who filed a 2018 return but not one in 2019. Treasury officials also cited language in the CARES Act that demanded the payments be made as \u201crapidly as possible\u201d as to why Treasury and IRS used policies and procedures developed in 2008 for stimulus payments, and consequently \u201cdid not use the death records as a filter to halt payments to decedents in the first three batches of payments\u201d in an effort to fulfill that mandate from Congress. NEXT STIMULUS PACKAGE WILL BE JOBS-FOCUSED: MNUCHIN\u00a0 The report said that IRS had implemented a process to use death records to update taxpayer accounts in 2013, and that bypassing that control \u201csubstantially increased the risk of potentially making improper payments to decedents.\u201d The report, citing the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, says that $1.4 billion went to dead people as of April 30. Treasury officials told the GAO that \u201cupon learning that payments had been made to decedents, Treasury and IRS, in consultation with counsel, determined that a person is not entitled to receive a payment if he or she is deceased as of the date the payment is to be paid.\" Officials then removed such payments starting with the fourth batch of payments and on May 6, the IRS announced that payments to dead or incarcerated people should be returned. However, it said it didn\u2019t plan to take further steps to notify people on how to return them. It's unclear what part of that money may have been spent, if relatives or other associates were able to access their accounts for direct deposits or somehow\u00a0able to cash checks. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The report recommends a number of steps, including the IRS taking further efforts to notify people how to return such payments, and for Congress to amend the Social Security Act to allow the SSA to share death data with the Treasury. President Trump said this week he wants to do another round of stimulus checks, although he didn\u2019t say when, or how much the checks would be. \u201cWe will be doing another stimulus package, it\u2019ll be very good, it\u2019ll be very generous,\u201d he said.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. EXCLUSIVE:\u00a0The majority of eligible Americans will receive their coronavirus aid\u00a0payments no later than April 15, Fox News has learned. A senior Treasury official told Fox News on Friday that by the middle of next week, tens of millions of eligible Americans will have money\u00a0from the federal government directly deposited into their bank accounts. CORONAVIRUS CHECKS ARE ON THEIR WAY: HERE'S HOW IT WORKS Payments are already hitting some people\u2019s accounts as of Friday evening, Fox News is told. The official said\u00a0Treasury is transmitting the batch of payments to the Federal Reserve for distribution\u00a0to financial institutions across the nation. Those financial institutions will then distribute the payments into Americans\u2019 bank accounts. The official explained that this first batch of payments will be received by Americans who filed their taxes in 2018 and/or in 2019 and received a refund via direct deposit. Filers who did not receive a refund electronically in the last tax year will soon be able to expedite their payment by submitting their bank information to the IRS via the \u201cGet My Payment\u201d app, which the federal government is launching next week. Those who do not file taxes are now able to go to the IRS website and use the \u201cNon-Filers: Enter Payment Info Here\u201d section to enter their bank information in\u00a0order to receive their payment faster than they would via regular mail. THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK, STATE-BY-STATE The official said the Treasury Department is also working around the clock to automatically process payments for Social Security and railroad retirement recipients who did not file a tax return in 2018 or 2019. Those payments, according to the official, are anticipated in the coming weeks and will primarily be issued\u00a0electronically. Meanwhile, millions more economic impact payments will be issued via direct deposit in the coming weeks, as the Treasury\u00a0issues payments to Social Security recipients, and as other taxpayers provide their banking information on the tools provided through the IRS website and the new app. \u201cWe are working to secure the fast, secure and efficient delivery of payments to veterans, disabled, and other vulnerable populations,\u201d the official added. During the 2008 financial crisis, officials told Fox News that it took the Obama administration \u201cseveral months\u201d before the first stimulus payments were issued to Americans. The official touted the efficiency of the Trump administration, which is expected to complete this round of payments in weeks. \u201cThis in and of itself is a major achievement,\u201d an official told Fox News. As part of the CARES Act, people who file their taxes as individuals are eligible for payments up to $1,200, and couples who file jointly are eligible for up to $2,400 plus an\u00a0additional $500 per child under the age of 17. The amount decreases for individuals who earn an adjusted gross income of\u00a0more than $75,000 and couples who earn more than $150,000 a year, by $5 for every $100 in income above those marks. This means the payment is less the higher their earnings are, with it being reduced to zero for individuals\u00a0who make $99,000 or more and couples who make $198,000 or more. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE People who file as heads of household\u00a0are eligible for payments of up to $1,200 plus $500 per child under 17. That amount is reduced for people who earn an adjusted gross income of more than $112,000 a year. The extent to which it is decreased depends on how many children they have. Payment amounts may also be offset by any past due child support payments that have been reported to the Treasury Department. The payments\u00a0do not count as taxable income. Similarly, they do not count for determining eligibility for federal programs like Supplemental Security Income. Fox News\u2019 Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.

        "text": "Games\nMark Meadows, White House Chief of Staff, discusses the likelihood of another coronavirus stimulus package The White House is reportedly considering issuing a new\u00a0round of executive actions amid dwindling hopes for a bipartisan coronavirus relief deal. Trump administration officials have discussed efforts to unilaterally provide support for the beleaguered airline industry and bolster federal unemployment benefits, according to The Washington Post, citing two people aware of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The administration has also weighed moving without Congress on allocating more money for school vouchers, and changing President Trump's temporary payroll tax deferral to make it more effective, the Post reported. WASHINGTON IMPASSE ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF THREATENS US ECONOMY The Constitution gives Congress, not the president,\u00a0the authority to determine federal spending. At the beginning of August, Trump circumvented Congress -- deadlocked over another round of emergency relief --\u00a0and signed four executive actions to partially restore unemployment benefits at $300 a week and\u00a0defer payroll tax payments through the end of the year for workers earning less than $104,000, discourage evictions and defer student loan payments. Although lawmakers joined forces in March to pass a massive $2.2 trillion stimulus deal by near-unanimity,\u00a0negotiations on another aid package collapsed at the beginning of August. There have been no signs of detente since then, with both sides accusing the other of playing politics. \u201cDemocrats just point fingers, call names and keep blocking American families from getting any more help before the November election,\u201d Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,\u00a0said Wednesday on the Senate floor. JOB GROWTH OVER NEXT DECADE EXPECTED TO BE SLOWER THAN AFTER 2008 CRISIS Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,\u00a0meanwhile, accused McConnell of \"looking for political cover\" instead of bipartisan cooperation with the planned floor vote on the $300 billion legislation. \"It won\u2019t pass on Thursday, and we\u2019ll be right back where we are today: needing our Republican colleagues to understand the gravity of the situation in our country, and work with us on a bill that actually makes some sense and deals with the magnitude of this awful crisis,\" he said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, one of the lead negotiators for the White House, said his focus now is ensuring Congress passes a stopgap measure to keep federal agencies open beyond Sept. 30. (Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0said they have agreed to work on a short-term spending bill to avoid a government shutdown on Oct. 1.) He said he was unsure whether the two sides could reach a compromise on another round of emergency relief. Asked on Wednesday about the odds for a deal\u00a0this year, Mnuchin said,\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see. I hope there is. It\u2019s important to a lot of people out there.\" The\u00a0Senate\u00a0returned to Washington on Tuesday\u00a0from its four-week August recess and have a floor vote planned Thursday on a \"skinny\" $300 billion relief bill that Democrats have already panned. The\u00a0House is scheduled to return on Monday for about three weeks.\u00a0But even if McConnell secures 51 GOP votes,\u00a0the legislation will not receive the necessary 60 votes to advance. Lawmakers are working on an increasingly tight deadline, with just a few weeks before they leave Washington to campaign ahead of the Nov. 3 election. WHY DID THE WASHINGTON POST SIT ON BOB WOODWARD'S TRUMP RECORDINGS? Last week, Trump floated the possibility of reallocating\u00a0$300 billion in unused coronavirus relief funds to send Americans a second $1,200 stimulus check. He suggested he could use executive authority to release the money, but suggested he would prefer that Congress sign off on the proposal. \"We have $300 billion in an account that we didn't use. I would be willing to release it, subject to Congress, and use that as stimulus money and it would go right to the American people,\" Trump said Friday during a White House press briefing. Trump did not specify what the funding source is, but may have been referring to unused business loan money approved by lawmakers at the end of March in the $2.2 trillion CARES Act. Under the\u00a0stimulus package, Congress appropriated $500 billion to the Treasury,\u00a0with $454 billion intended to cover losses on Federal Reserve lending programs. So far,\u00a0$259 billion\u00a0of that funding remains uncommitted. \"It's money that we have \u2014 money that we built up and money that we haven\u2019t spent, and I would love to give it to the American people as a very powerful stimulus,\" Trump said. While the nation's economy has mounted a tepid recovery, new government data released last week shows the labor market is still far from pre-crisis levels: Employers added 1.4 million jobs in August and the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, but there are still 11.5 million more out-of-work Americans than there were in February.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, doubled down Friday on his opposition to $2,000 stimulus checks and Republicans again blocked last-ditch efforts to approve the enhanced coronavirus relief. McConnell dismissed the $2,000 checks as a \"universal cash giveaway\" and not the right approach to provide targeted relief to those who need it most.\u00a0 \"A huge chunk would essentially\u00a0be socialism for rich people,\" McConnell said during a floor speech on New Year's Day.\u00a0 HAWLEY UPS PRESSURE FOR $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS: 'LET'S VOTE NOW' Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., balked at the notion that Republicans are now concerned about \"socialism for rich people\" when he said they were OK passing huge tax breaks for\u00a0corporations. For added effect, he brought poster-sized checks to the Senate floor showing the millions in tax rebates companies like Amazon, Chevron and Delta Airlines received. Fox News correspondent David Spunt joins 'Special Report' from Washington, D.C. with the latest. \"That is what socialism for the rich is about,\" Sanders said of the corporate giveaways. \"Socialism for the rich is not\u00a0 -- in the midst of this terrible pandemic -- putting a $2,000 check into the hands of working families.\" \"I see, if I may say so, a\u00a0bit of hypocrisy here,\" Sanders added. Sanders, with the support of Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., attempted to bring a vote on $2,000 checks legislation on Friday. He also sought a vote on a\u00a0McConnell-backed plan that pairs the $2,000 checks with measures on election security and curbing\u00a0Big Tech\u00a0-- two other priorities of President Trump. HOUSE PASSES BILL TO HIKE STIMULUS PAYMENTS TO AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS But Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, objected to the request for the votes, on behalf of an absent Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Penn., which effectively quashed the chances of $2,000 checks passing the\u00a0Senate. Time was running out for a vote since the current Congress\u00a0ends on Sunday. Any pending\u00a0legislation would die and have to be reintroduced in the new session.\u00a0 Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., spoke about the urgency of the matter in a floor speech Friday before Republicans rejected his separate request for a vote.\u00a0 \"If the Senate does not take action today, $2,000 checks will not become law before the end of Congress and they will know that Leader McConnell and the Republican majority have prevented them from getting the checks -- plain and simple,\" Schumer said. \"This is the last chance.\" STIMULUS CHECKS ROUND 2: WHAT TO EXPECT Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., objected to Schumer's request for a vote on the $2,000 checks arguing that\u00a0sending checks to families making six-figures and unaffected by the pandemic is\u00a0\"not fiscally responsible.\" \"It is not targeted to help those who are most in need,\" Thune said.\u00a0 MCCONNELL AGAIN BLOCKS QUICK VOTE ON $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS, SLAMS 'SOCIALISM FOR RICH PEOPLE' Congress already passed $600 checks as part of a broader $900 billion aid package. Those checks are currently being distributed. While Trump signed the bipartisan legislation, he also demanded\u00a0bigger checks of $2,000. The House agreed by passing standalone legislation and sending it to the Senate, where it was blocked. Hawley expressed frustration that a measure that would pass the Senate can't even get a vote. \"This seems to be the Senate versus the United States of America,\" Hawley said.\u00a0 Marisa Schultz is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. The White House is moving forward with a proposed $1 trillion coronavirus package that would infuse Americans' bank accounts with two rounds of direct cash payments. The Trump administration is seeking $250 billion in payments to Americans starting\u00a0April 6, followed by another $250 billion cash payment round beginning\u00a0May 18, according to the working draft of the plan obtained by Fox Business Network. The two payments to taxpayers would be identical and the amounts would vary by family income and size, according to the Treasury Department document on the \"Stage Three\" coronavirus proposal. The Washington Post first reported the document. AOC AND ALLIED PROGRESSIVES SEEK MONTHLY CASH PAYMENTS, RENT 'SUSPENSION' IN CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE The draft of the plan outlines a major economic infusion that goes well beyond the stimulus and bailout plans during the last financial crisis and designed to prop up an economy that has ground to a halt as stores and restaurants and schools are shuttering nationwide and families are isolating at home. The Trump administration\u2019s stimulus package is bigger than the 2008 bank bailout, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was passed and signed under former President Barack Obama\u00a0and totaled $787 billion to help stabilize the economy about 14 months after the last recession began. Congress and President Trump already approved an\u00a0$8.3 billion package to prop up the health care system to respond\u00a0to the pandemic. The Senate Wednesday sent another bill to Trump's desk to give 14 paid sick days to workers, boost unemployment insurance, make coronavirus testing free and increase food assistance during the crisis; Trump signed it into law hours later. But, all sides have agreed that the government needed to pass a\u00a0third round of stimulus as soon as possible to help small businesses stay afloat, aid workers who have lost jobs and give the economy a jolt as American consumers nationwide have been stuck home. TRUMP CALLS HIMSELF A \u2018WARTIME PRESIDENT\u2019 OVER CORONAVIRUS AS HE INVOKES DEFENSE PRODUCTION ACT The administration's working plan amounts to $1 trillion on paper. It would provide $50 billion for lending to the\u00a0airline industry, which has drastically reduced flights due to travel bans and social distancing. The proposal would require \"limits on\u00a0increases in\u00a0executive pay\" until the loans are repaid. The proposal calls for $150 billion to \"other severely distressed sectors of the U.S. economy\" through secured lending or loan guarantees. Trump signaled Wednesday that airlines, cruise ships and hotel industries are all \"prime candidates\" for support. The Trump administration also wants $300 billion to help small businesses, which have suffered under social isolation and various cities banning\u00a0dine-in services at bars and restaurants in an effort to\u00a0prevent the spread of COVID-19. The administration would create a \"small business interruption loan program\" targeted at businesses with fewer than 500 employees that would cover six weeks of payroll. The amount for each employee's wages would be capped at $1,540 per week, or about $80,000 a year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has taken the lead on negotiations with Congress on the coronavirus response. He worked closely with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on developing the paid sick days and emergency leave program. Now the third round of legislation is being developed with GOP senators. The negotiations are ongoing, and Trump administration officials cautioned the plan is fast-moving and in flux. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Senate won't recess until a third-round proposal is passed. Then it would head to the House for approval.

Lawmakers\u00a0also passed a one-day stopgap spending bill to prevent a government shutdown at midnight Sunday.\u00a0 The Associated Press reported that if the deal is finalized, it will be the largest spending measure, which combines the COVID-19 relief with a $1.4 trillion government-wide funding plan that the New York Times\u00a0referred\u00a0to as a $2.3 trillion behemoth.\" After days of negotiations, McConnell said he was \"relieved\" that a deal was in the offing. Senate Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer of N.Y., walks on Capitol Hill in Washington, Dec. 15.\u00a0 (AP) The House and Senate were expected to vote on the legislation on Monday.\u00a0Before hitting the full House for a vote,\u00a0the relief bill first must go through the House Rules Committee, though it remains unclear when that will be.\u00a0 Fox News' Chad Pergram tweeted early Monday that the House Rules Committee\u00a0could meet as early as 8 a.m.\u00a0to prepare the bill for the floor. \"Timing for House debate is unclear,\" Pergram wrote.\u00a0\"But the House will go first, followed by the Senate. Senate doesn\u2019t meet until noon.\" According to congressional leaders, the agreement would establish temporary $300 per week supplemental jobless benefits and $600 direct stimulus payments to most Americans, along with a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses and money for schools, health care providers, and renters facing eviction.\u00a0 \"At long last we have a bipartisan breakthrough the country has needed,\" McConnell said, according to the Wall Street\u00a0Journal. \"Now we need to promptly finalize text, avoid any last-minute obstacles and cooperate to move this legislation through both chambers.\" Special Assistant to the President\u00a0Ben Williamson in a statement, \"President Trump has pushed hard for months to send Americans badly needed financial relief. We look forward to Congress sending a bill to his desk imminently for signature.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a joint statement their goal is to \"crush the virus and put money in the pockets of the American people.\"\u00a0 \"Today, we have reached an agreement with Republicans and the White House on an emergency coronavirus relief and omnibus package that delivers urgently needed funds to save the lives and livelihoods of the American people as the virus accelerates,\"\u00a0it said. SEN. BARRASSO ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL: 'THIS GETS DONE TODAY' Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., questions Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during a Congressional Oversight Commission hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, Dec. 10. (Sarah Silbiger/The Washington Post via AP, Pool) (AP) Senators held talks on Capitol Hill late Saturday when\u00a0Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., hit the Senate floor with a list of grievances on the $900 billion package. But Fox News learned late Saturday that Toomey agreed to compromise language from his initial proposal that would have prevented the Federal Reserve chairman from establishing federal lending programs similar to those set up in March to help credit markets function\u00a0during massive U.S. economic shutdowns. \"These new emergency lending facilities were always\u00a0intended to sunset at end of this year,\" McConnell said on Sunday. \"Sen.\u00a0Toomey and our Democratic colleagues have landed on compromise language that ensures this will, in fact, happen. It also redirects the dormant money in these accounts toward the urgent needs of working Americans and ensures that these expiring programs cannot be simply restarted or cloned without another authorization from Congress, all while preserving both the independence of the Federal Reserve and proper authority of Congress.\" TOOMEY, SCHUMER REPORTEDLY REACH AGREEMENT ON COVID RELIEF BILL LANGUAGE The apparent compromise, following discussions between Toomey and Schumer, appeared to open a path to a final agreement on the coronavirus package. The plan\u00a0was to load the $900 billion coronavirus bill onto a $1.4 trillion omnibus spending plan to fund the government through Sept.\u00a030, 2021.\u00a0 Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told \"Fox News Sunday\" that\u00a0the deal is expected to\u00a0include $600 checks to most Americans, covering adults and children, extended unemployment benefits, and additional paycheck protection loans for small businesses. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, speaks during a news conference with other Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill in Washington, while Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, listens at left.\u00a0 (AP) After the announcement, Schumer and Pelosi offered additional details, including $25 billion in rental assistance, $15 billion for theaters and other live venues, $82 billion for local schools, colleges, and universities, and $10 billion for child care.\u00a0 But Pelosi qualified that the bill was only an initial step, telling her colleagues in a letter that \"more help will be on the way\" when President-elect Joe Biden enters the White House.\u00a0 The bill also was an engine to carry much of Capitol Hill's unfinished business, including a 400-page water resources bill that targets $10 billion for 46 Army Corps of Engineers flood control, environmental and coastal protection projects. Another addition would extend a batch of soon-to-expire tax breaks, including one for craft brewers, wineries\u00a0and distillers.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP House Democrats had passed a massive $3 trillion HEROES Act that Senate Republicans rejected in favor of a more targeted approach to helping American people and businesses.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,\u00a0told\u00a0\"The Story with Martha MacCallum\" Thursday that the Senate is \"not quite ready to intelligently\" lay out\u00a0the next coronavirus stimulus package, but added \"it's not too far off.\" \"The [CARES] Act, which passed\u00a0a month or so ago on a bipartisan basis, only about half of that money has gone out yet,\" McConnell said.\u00a0\"I think there's a high likelihood we will do another rescue package, but we need to be able to measure the impact of what we've already done, what we did right, what we did wrong [and]\u00a0correct that. \"Let me tell you what it won't be,\" McConnell added. \"It won't be a $3 trillion\u00a0left-wing wish list as it passed the House.\" STIMULUS CHECKS, STATE AID AND MORE: WHAT\u2019S IN HOUSE DEMOCRATS' NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL The majority leader went on to say that lawmakers \"need to work smart here, help the people who are desperately in need, try to save as many jobs as possible and begin to open up the states, which are decisions by the governors that are going on all over America now and get this economy growing again.\" With that in mind, McConnell said any new stimulus\u00a0package would not include enhanced unemployment benefits. \"The problem was by paying people more not to work than to work, it's making it difficult to get people back to work. You can understand that,\" McConnell told MacCallum. \"We do need to continue unemployment insurance, [it's] extremely important at a time like this. \"But to pay people more not to work than to work doesn't encourage resuming your job. And that will end in July. And we think that in order to create jobs, we need to incentivize people to go back to work, not encourage them to stay home.\" The senator also reemphasized the need for businesses to receive liability protections in any future stimulus. \"You're going to have liability protection in there so that people, or\u00a0the plaintiffs' lawyers are prevented from stealing, in effect, all of this public money we're sending down to hospitals and doctors and non-profits as a result of the coronavirus,\" McConnell told MacCallum. \"And so that's one of our red lines, that the next bill will need to have liability protection in there just to cover narrowly cover the coronavirus, not anything else.\" CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE McConnell also responded to criticism that such liability\u00a0provisions\u00a0would shield\u00a0nursing homes and care facilities where coronavirus victims died from legal action \"Well, the answer is it wouldn't protect any nursing home from from a gross negligence or intentional misbehavior [claim],\" McConnell said. \"So it's not an absolute protection against any kind of behavior.

        "text": "Games\n'Special Report' anchor Bret Baier breaks down the new COVID relief bill, White House press briefing ethics, Vice President Kamala Harris's West Virginia mistake, and more on 'America Reports.' The \"vote-a-rama\" in the Senate that started at about 2:30 p.m. Thursday concluded shortly before 6 a.m. Friday after a marathon process in which Republicans forced Democrats to take votes on tough issues for more than 15 hours.\u00a0 The Senate adopted a budget resolution for coronavirus relief 51-50 with Vice President Harris casting the tie-breaking vote. It's not a final bill, but allows the Senate to proceed toward a final bill under the budget reconciliation rules, which would let Democrats pass\u00a0a coronavirus stimulus plan by going around a GOP filibuster as long as their caucus remains united. The House is expected to move on the \"concurrent\" budget resolution later Friday. Senate\u00a0Republicans were taking\u00a0advantage of a Senate procedure that allows them to propose a plethora of amendments to the budget resolution, forcing senators to take a stand on a number of issues.\u00a0 REPUBLICANS PUT DEMOCRATS ON THE SPOT OVER STIMULUS CHECKS, TAXES IN MARATHON 'VOTE-A-RAMA' \"I am so thankful that our caucus stayed together in unity. We had no choice given the problems facing America and the desire to move forward. And we have moved forward,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said. \"Many bipartisan amendments were adopted, so this was a bipartisan activity.\" He added: \"We cannot underscore enough how much help America needs during this awful crisis and we cannot miss the point that we still have a long way to go. This was a giant first step... to bring America back, to overcome this horrible crisis and then move America forward.\" Though some GOP amendments were adopted, the\u00a0final vote was along party lines. Among the issues Republicans forced votes on were efforts to support the remain in Mexico policy from the Trump administration, oppose the blocking of\u00a0the Keystone XL Pipeline by President Biden, oppose banning fracking, oppose the increase of the federal minimum wage during the pandemic and more.\u00a0 A final Democratic amendment proposed by Schumer undid three GOP-proposed amendments that passed with bipartisan majorities on fracking, the Keystone XL Pipeline and opposing stimulus checks for illegal immigrants. Harris cast the tiebreaking vote on that too.\u00a0 In all, the Senate took 41 roll call votes between Thursday and Friday.\u00a0 Senate Minority Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., previously indicated that Republicans would drag out the process with the aim of extracting a pound of flesh from Democrats in uncomfortable votes.\u00a0 \"We're going to put senators on the record,\" he said on Thursday. \"Expect votes to stop Washington from actively killing jobs during a recovery \u2014 like terminating the Keystone pipeline; that job-killing, one-size-fits-all minimum wage hike; and whether to bar tax hikes on small businesses for the duration of this emergency.\"\u00a0 He'd also previously said Republicans would bring up amendments on stimulus checks for illegal immigrants, federal funding for school\u00a0districts that don't get children in classrooms and more.\u00a0 In other amendments during the vote-a-rama, the Senate voted 97-3 to support keeping the U.S. Embassy in Israel in Jerusalem; 50-50 on a failed amendment to support the border wall; 50-50 on a failed\u00a0amendment supporting the free exercise of religion; 100-0 to oppose the defunding of police; 50-50 on a failed amendment to oppose packing the Supreme Court; 50-50 on a failed amendment opposing stimulus checks for people in prison; 50-50 on a failed amendment opposing the Biden administration's move to restrict oil and gas leasing on federal lands; 50-50 on a failed amendment opposing a federal carbon tax; 53-47 in favor of an amendment supporting the expansion of health savings accounts; and more.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Schumer Thursday criticized Republicans for planning to introduce \"messaging amendments\" to \"score political points.\"\u00a0 \"What amendments our friends in the minority propose is entirely up to them,\" Schumer said. He added that he hopes Republicans don't use \"the debate over pandemic relief to sharpen...\u00a0partisan talking points.\" Schumer continued: \"If there are good-faith amendments from the other side, we look forward to them.\" Tyler Olson is a Capitol Hill Producer for Fox News in Washington, D.C.

        "text": "Games\nFox News correspondent Mark Meredith has the latest from West Palm Beach, Florida. President Trump\u2019s Sunday night decision to sign the combination COVID relief/government spending plan averts a shutdown tomorrow night. The government was funded through 11:59\u00a0p.m.\u00a0Monday. But Mr. Trump\u2019s signature means the government is now funded through September 30, 2021. The President railed against the combination package last week \u2013 even though the final plan was negotiated by the top four bicameral, bipartisan Congressional leaders and his own point man Treasury Secretary\u00a0Steve Mnuchin. The plan passed with 359 votes in the House and 92 votes in the Senate. SUPERMARKET CHAIN GIVES $200K IN GIFT CARDS TO STRUGGLING RESTAURANTS AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC President Trump objected to foreign aid provisions which he deemed \"pork\" in the spending provision of the combination measure \u2013 even though the president requested much of that money in his budget request sent to Congress earlier this year. Many Republicans opposed any stimulus checks. But after wrangling, the sides settled on $600 checks. Then last week, the president, who was absent from the negotiations, demanded $2,000 direct payments and refused to sign the legislation into law. So, House Democrats prepped a bill to provide for $2,000 payment checks. This bill will be on the floor late Monday. At this stage, Fox News is told the House will subject this to a two-thirds vote for passage. Watch to see if Republicans align with the president now \u2013 or toe their line. By handling this bill as a \"suspension\" measure (a process that speeds the bill to the floor but requires a two-thirds vote for passage), approving the plan isn\u2019t guaranteed. But Fox News is told by a member of the House GOP leadership that the measure should secure two-thirds. Democrats are essentially daring Republicans to vote no. Hitting the two-thirds threshold is a challenge. But, if the House goes through the usual process for the bill, the measure will just be subject to a simple majority for passage. BRITISH GOVERNMENT PLANS TO APPROVE OXFORD VACCINE, DISTRIBUTE STARTING JAN. 4 Democrats crafted the bill in a way to make the implementation of $2,000 checks contingent on the president signing the combo COVID/government funding plan. So, once the President saw the opportunity for the $2,000 with the House planning a bill, he agreed to sign the plan. If the House passes the bill, it\u2019s onto the Senate. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., declared on Christmas Eve that he didn\u2019t think the Senate would have the appetite to tackle $2,000 in direct payments. Then, the question is whether the Senate can handle such a package. The bill could be subject to one if not two filibusters. One, just to start a debate on the bill. The other, to finish the debate on the bill. Both steps require 60 votes to neutralize a filibuster. And, if the Senate does it by the book, the measure could take several days to process. However, if the Senate has the cooperation of all 100 senators, it can move very fast. However, one senior GOP source doubted that the Senate could tackle the plan once it comes over from the House. And\u00a0Trump\u2019s maneuver puts GOPers in a tight spot. Support his plan and flip their position \u2013 just because he said so -- or, stand their ground and face the president\u2019s ire. Had the President not signed the package, Washington was barreling toward a government shutdown. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It\u2019s now obvious that no one truly knew what the president would sign. Or, had President Trump hornswoggled multiple Congressional leaders, hundreds of Congressional Republicans and key players in his administration into believing he would sign this particular package? Unclear. In conventional circumstances, had Congress faced a government shutdown threat, the House and Senate would have rushed to prepare another interim spending bill. But that wasn\u2019t in the cards. To Congress, it was this bill or nothing. It was too much of a legislative lift just to advance this plan. And even if there were an emergency bill, no one knew if the president would sign that. Moreover, there was a holiday scheduling problem. The House meets Monday afternoon. The Senate isn\u2019t even meeting until Tuesday. So that meant there would be a shutdown if President Trump declined to sign the existing bill before 11:59:59 pm Monday. A government shutdown is always bad. But a shutdown now would have marked the second shutdown around the holidays in three years. A shutdown means federal law enforcement officers, working under COVID conditions don\u2019t get paid. It may also have slowed the rollout of the coronavirus vaccine. Or, those who are charged with helping distribute the vaccine may have been working, sans pay. A shutdown could have meant furloughs for civilian Pentagon employees. Active duty military personnel are deemed essential, but they probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten paychecks, depending on the length of the shutdown. TSA screeners and air traffic controllers are considered essential, processing holiday, pandemic travel. But they wouldn\u2019t have gotten paid. Would they have been willing to work, gratis, under such circumstances? Keep in mind that glaring absences by air traffic controllers during the 2018-2019 shutdown started to threaten safety. Their truancy prompted an end to that shutdown. And for everyone demanding that Congressional pay cease during a government shutdown, you\u2019re out of luck. The 27th\u00a0Amendment to the Constitution is clear: \"No law varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened,\" reads the amendment. In other words, lawmakers get paid, no matter what. Shutdown or not. One may argue what \"varying\" means. Some members may elect to place their pay in escrow or donate their salaries to charitable causes during this period. But they still get \"paid.\" There can\u2019t be any \"varying in the compensation\" until the midterm election of 2022. Don\u2019t like it? Get a vote of three-quarters of all states and two-thirds of both the House and Senate to amend the Constitution. But President Trump signed the bill. That means there won\u2019t be any question about funding the government until next fall. And then the decision to sign or not to sign, will be up to President-elect Biden.

The majority leader has said that President Trump wants the stimulus checks, repeal of Section 230 and a congressional commission to review voter fraud, passed in one package. \"President Trump couldn\u2019t care less about how the bills are packaged in Congress,\" Schumer said Thursday. \"The Republican leader [McConnell] has invented an excuse to prevent a clean up-and-down yes and no vote on $2,000 checks coming to the floor.\" Schumer claimed McConnell\u2019s refusal to vote on the issues separately was because he \"intended to kill the possibility of $2,000 checks ever becoming law.\" GOP senators took heat from the president after passing the latest stimulus package that included $600 stimulus checks, a figure Republican lawmakers refused to increase despite Democrat calls for $1,200 checks. Trump called the sum \"ridiculously low\" in a late-night address last week. He called\u00a0on Congress to pass a new round of checks and deliver it to his desk by Sunday before the new Congress enters office \u2013 a challenge looking increasingly unlikely. Schumer said that he and his fellow Democrats were willing to vote on repealing Section 230 \u2013 a policy under the 1996 Communications Decency Act that protects tech companies from content posted on their websites by third parties or\u00a0users. The president has\u00a0called\u00a0Section 230 \"a serious threat to our National Security & Election Integrity.\" He has taken issue with the law that he believes unfairly protects social media giants like Twitter and Facebook.\u00a0 \"Unless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH!\" Trump tweeted Tuesday. \"Also, get rid of Section 230 - Don\u2019t let Big Tech steal our Country, and don\u2019t let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough!\" he wrote. Schumer pushed for the Senate to vote on repealing Section 230 by using McConnell\u2019s \"own language,\" but claimed the majority leader wouldn\u2019t support the vote because \"he knows his caucus wouldn\u2019t actually support such an act.\" \"Let\u2019s be very clear, there is one way, and only one way, to pass $2,000 checks before the end of the year. And that\u2019s to pass the House bill. It\u2019s the only way to get the American people the checks they need and deserve,\" Schumer said. The House passed legislation earlier this week that would increase the $600 stimulus checks in the $900 billion package Trump signed Sunday, by $1,400. The issue over stimulus checks has not only increased partisan infighting in Congress as the year draws to a close but also within the Republican Party. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\u00a0 Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.,\u00a0and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., have crossed party lines to say they support increasing the stimulus checks to $2,000. But McConnell dismissed the calls for increased checks as a ploy for Democrats to employ \"socialism for rich people\" \u2013 a remark that infuriated Schumer. \"I hope that every American who has their water or heat or electricity shut off, or had eviction notices stapled on top of one another to their door, or had to choose what meal to skip on a given day, I hope they all heard the reason they will not receive $2,000 checks,\" Schumer said in a heated Senate floor address Thursday. \u00a0 Caitlin McFall is a Reporter at Fox News Digital covering Politics, U.S. and World news.

        "text": "Games\nPresident Trump on Tuesday said he has instructed Republicans to pause negotiations on a coronavirus stimulus package until after the election, instructing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to focus \u201cfull-time\u201d on getting his nominee to fill the vacant seat on the U.S. Supreme Court approved. Trump said in a Twitter post that negotiations would resume after the election, at which time a bill would be passed to support small businesses and hardworking Americans. He also accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., of pushing for a $2.4 trillion package that would act as a bailout to \u201cpoorly run, high crime, Democrat States.\u201d PELOSI, MNUCHIN HAGGLE OVER CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PACKAGE PRICE TAG AS TALKS CONTINUE\u00a0 U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Pelosi spoke on Tuesday, Pelosi\u2019s chief of staff said on Twitter, where Mnuchin is said to have confirmed that the president had walked away from discussions. As\u00a0previously reported by FOX Business, House Democrats passed a $2.2 trillion revised HEROES Act last week, in a largely symbolic move because Mnuchin said that Republicans would not approve a $2.2 trillion package. Mnuchin noted that President Trump instructed Republicans to come up from their original negotiating point of $1 trillion \u2013 and the Treasury Secretary suggested that the number being discussed was somewhere in the \u201cneighborhood\u201d of $1.5 trillion. STILL NEED YOUR CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS CHECK? KEY DEADLINES TO KNOW On Tuesday, Trump said Republicans were willing to agree to a $1.6 trillion bill. Democrats had originally proposed the $3 trillion HEROES Act in May, which was approved by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives without Republican support.

        "text": "Games\nMore than 20,000 National Guardsmen are deployed to Washington, D.C. as the FBI monitors possible threats; Florida Republican Rep. Michael Waltz reacts to the security measures being put into place. Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., took issue Friday with President-elect\u00a0Joe Biden's\u00a0massive $1.9 trillion stimulus package proposal that aims to combat\u00a0the coronavirus\u00a0and attempt to pump up a U.S.\u00a0economy\u00a0severely battered by the worst\u00a0pandemic\u00a0to strike the globe in a century. In an address to the nation Thursday, Biden spelled out his plans to speed the nation\u2019s COVID vaccination program, boost coronavirus testing capacity to help reopen businesses and schools, provide for $1,400 stimulus checks for Americans and federal funds for state and local governments to use to avoid laying off police officers, firefighters and other first responders, as well as teachers and health workers. Biden labeled it his \"American Rescue Plan.\" But Waltz said on \"Fox & Friends\" that he views the measure as a \"bailout\" for Democrat-run states, such as New York and California, which\u00a0did not handle the COVID-19 pandemic as effectively as Florida. BIDEN UNVEILS MASSIVE RESCUE PACKAGE - AND AOC IMMEDIATELY HAS A PROBLEM WITH IT REP.\u00a0 MICHAEL WALTZ: This is a\u00a0bailout package for blue states for their bad policies, for\u00a0their lockdown policies. The best\u00a0stimulus that we could have as a country is to allow the economy\u00a0to smartly and safely open like\u00a0we have done in Florida.\u00a0Kids have been in school in\u00a0person since last August.\u00a0And we are not having a\u00a0statewide meltdown.\u00a0 You can wear masks and space out\u00a0and go to school because we\u00a0take the approach of letting\u00a0business owners and individuals\u00a0and families make those smart\u00a0decisions, rather than these mass\u00a0policies from lockdowns and our\u00a0numbers aren't any worse or\u00a0aren't any different than\u00a0California and New York, but,\u00a0you know, now they have these\u00a0massive state budget deficits.\u00a0 They have to fill that hole.\u00a0States have to balance their budget, the\u00a0federal government doesn't.\u00a0So AOC and now Joe Biden are\u00a0going to the big piggy bank in\u00a0the sky that\u00a0prints nonstop\u00a0money.\u00a0Here is the thing,\u00a0our\u00a0spending package that we passed\u00a0was $1.5 trillion.\u00a0 CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP We have now spent over six\u00a0trillion and counting and\u00a0bringing it full circle to the\u00a0bigger picture, you know, the\u00a0Chinese military, their command\u00a0is counting on this country\u00a0going bankrupt before they then\u00a0make their big moves around the\u00a0world.\u00a0And every estimate I have seen\u00a0has accelerated that between\u00a02024 and 2026 now with this additional\u00a0spending.\u00a0 David Montanaro is a Senior Editor with Fox News.

        "text": "Games\nThis is a rush transcript from \"Your World,\" June 10, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: I think we\u2019re going to seriously look at whether we want to do more direct money to stimulate the economy.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: All right, that seems to be the Treasury secretary hinting, maybe telegraphing that more help is on the way for the economy, this as we got word from the Federal Reserve chairman that interest rates will stay at or roughly where they are now maybe for another couple of years.  That was one of the reasons why the Nasdaq, for example, climbed over 10000 today. We will get into that a little later in the show.  First, on this need for more stimulus, let\u2019s get the read from Idaho Republican Senator James Risch on all of that.  Senator, thank you for taking the time.  Do you think we need more stimulus?  SEN. JAMES RISCH (R-ID): Well, Neil, let me -- let me say that I started the hearing this morning by complimenting Secretary Mnuchin for how he\u2019s handled this.  When they write the history of COVID and the financial fallout from it, I told him I think he\u2019s going to get his own chapter in the book. He has just performed amazingly well.  As one who doesn\u2019t worship at the altar of government, I had real reservations about what we were doing. I voted for it. I thought it was the right thing to do. But when you throw in $2.8 trillion against the wall and hoping it\u2019s going to work, you know there\u2019s going to be glitches.  And the one thing I have seen said is that, look, if you listen to the national news or read the national news, you think that this thing is all full of problems. This has been a tremendous success.  PPP has benefited over 4.5 million business, tens of millions of employees. They have done a great job of that. Are there some glitches with it? Of course. But they\u2019re de minimis, compared to all the good that it\u2019s done.  So, they have done a great job. As far as more money, I have to tell you that enthusiasm for spending more is rapidly declining in these chambers, when we see what\u2019s happening to the economy.  If someone would have told you two months ago that the market was going to be where it is right now, the markets, you would have shook your head and said, that\u2019s impossible.  So, the places are opening. People are going back to work. So I would -- and not only that. Out of the $2.8 trillion that was appropriated, less than half of it has been put to work. So, there\u2019s a lot more money sitting on the sidelines that can go into the economy.  CAVUTO: So, you don\u2019t think it would be necessary to add to that for the time being?  Because Democrats argue just the opposite. We seem to be getting signals, sir, out of the White House that they\u2019re open to more. I think they want a payroll tax cut, things like that.  RISCH: Right.  CAVUTO: But they want to do more. It sounds like you\u2019re -- you\u2019re saying, go slow.  RISCH: Well, I am saying go slow.  I\u2019m not saying, don\u2019t do more. I\u2019m saying, let\u2019s wait and see. When you -- when you have put less than half of the almost $3 trillion to work, why don\u2019t we see how -- look at what that first half is done. Look where it\u2019s gotten us.  I mean, things are moving very rapidly today. And at the end of the day, it may need more. This is a unique circumstance that we\u2019re in. I\u2019m open to it. I think everybody is open to it.  But things are moving very rapidly now. And I think we ought to be cautious. We ought to put the next foot down slowly as we put it down.  CAVUTO: Senator, a couple of developments that, as a United States senator, I\u2019d be curious to get your take.  The president wants to pull troops, a lot of troops, maybe all of our troops, when all is said and done, out of Germany. How do you feel about that? Some of your colleagues were anxious about it.  RISCH: Well, I think everybody\u2019s anxious about it, because we don\u2019t know all the details yet. I haven\u2019t talked to the president since he -- since he has said that.  I will be doing that. We\u2019re all going to want to hear details about it. That\u2019s a longstanding contingent of people that we have there since World War II. It\u2019s really become a hub in the world for movement of troops, movement of equipment, particularly medical care for our troops.  We\u2019re going to want to hear some more details on it, and we will be discussing it with the president.  CAVUTO: While I also have you here, Senator, if you don\u2019t mind, Kayleigh McEnany today was asked a lot of questions on this elderly protester who was shoved by the police at a rally against the treatment of George Floyd, and that it was a setup.  Do you believe the president that this guy was a setup?  RISCH: Well, who knows?  You can find about anything you want on the Internet these days. I saw the video, like everybody else does. It\u2019s, what, 10 seconds\u2019 long or something like that.  CAVUTO: Right.  RISCH: This is why we have courts. This is why we have investigations. I think all this will come out.  I don\u2019t know who the gentleman was. I don\u2019t know what he was doing there. I don\u2019t know what he had in his hand. I don\u2019t know what the reality -- I\u2019m -- you hope the officers had body cameras on, so you can -- you can see what they were seeing as they approached the individual.  There\u2019s a long ways to go before you make a judgment on that. I\u2019m not ready to make a judgment one way or the other on it at this point.  CAVUTO: Well, the president did.  I don\u2019t mean to overstate this. And I\u2019m thinking the guy did fall. He was bleeding from the back of his head.  RISCH: Sure.  CAVUTO: And so do you think that was responsible, when we really don\u2019t know?  RISCH: Yes. You know, I -- I -- Neil, you -- what you ought to do is give the president a call.

RISCH: Well, I -- you know, I haven\u2019t reached a conclusion yet.  So, no, I wouldn\u2019t say what something is. Look, I was a prosecutor. I -- I prosecuted thousands of cases. And what I have learned is, you want to sift through the evidence really carefully before you move forward on something. Charging issues are always the most difficult there are.  As you proceed to trial, you better have your ducks in a row. But you want all the information before you reach the conclusion of where you want to take something.  CAVUTO: There\u2019s a concept.

        "text": "Games\nChad Pergram reports on House vote on stimulus package The U.S. House of Representatives approved a massive $1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus package early Saturday -- the sixth COVID bill passed since the pandemic began a year ago. The vote around 2 a.m. ET was 219-212. Two Democrats voted against their party's plan: U.S. Reps. Jared Golden of Maine and Kurt Schrader of Oregon. Both lawmakers also opposed a $3 trillion bill last May that\u00a0ultimately failed. Golden issued a statement defending his decision. \"During challenging times, the country needs its elected leaders to work together to meet the most urgent needs in their communities,\" Golden said, according to The Associated Press. \"This bill addresses urgent needs, and then buries them under a mountain of unnecessary or untimely spending.\" \"This bill addresses urgent needs, and then buries them under a mountain of unnecessary or untimely spending.\" U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, seen March 6, 2019, voted against the Democrats' latest coronavirus bill. (Roll Call)  Not a single Republican backed Saturday's bill.\u00a0About two hours before the vote, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy derided the proposal\u00a0as \"Pelosi\u2019s Payoff Bill.\" McCarthy, R-Calif., further described the legislation as \"Democrats\u2019 costly, corrupt and liberal spending package,\" one that he claimed signified, \"The Swamp is back.\" HOUSE TO VOTE ON BIDEN'S $1.9T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGE THAT INCLUDES $1,400 STIMULUS CHECKS \"Congress won\u2019t actually vote on this bill until 2 a.m. Saturday,\" McCarthy said. \"Why? Because Democrats are so embarrassed by all the non-COVID waste in this bill that they are jamming it through in the dead of night. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. (Associated Press)  \"We ran the numbers,\" McCarthy added. \"The amount of money that actually goes to defeating the virus is less than 9 percent \u2013 Less than 9 percent! So don\u2019t call it a rescue bill. Don\u2019t call it a relief bill. Call it the Pelosi Payoff.\" \"The amount of money that actually goes to defeating the virus is less than 9 percent \u2013 Less than 9 percent!\" Many Republicans particularly objected to Democrats\u2019 efforts to include a $15 minimum wage requirement as part of the package -- saying it would hurt businesses and cost many Americans their jobs.  The House bill passed Saturday morning included the $15 plan -- but the Democrats' effort was expected to run\u00a0into a roadblock in the Senate because\u00a0Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough this week decided that inclusion of the $15 plan would violate Senate rules. Shortly before midnight Friday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the bill in remarks on the House floor, declaring the $15 minimum wage goal would be achieved one way or another, regardless of MacDonough\u2019s ruling. \"It is inevitable to all of us, the $15 minimum wage will be achieved,\" Pelosi said, \"even if it is inconceivable to some, it is inevitable to us \u2013 and we will work diligently to shorten the distance between the inevitable and the inconceivable.\" The $15 minimum wage proposal is particularly important to progressives -- but other\u00a0House Democrats appeared pleased with the bill that was passed Saturday. \"I am a happy camper tonight,\" U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said, according to The Associated Press. \"This is what America needs. Republicans, you ought to be a part of this. But if you're not, we're going without you.\" \"Republicans, you ought to be a part of this. But if you're not, we're going without you.\" U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.  Lawmakers were rushing to send approved legislation to President Biden's desk by March 14, when key unemployment\u00a0aid programs for millions are set to expire. The proposal contains\u00a0a third $1,400 stimulus check for Americans earning less than $75,000 annually, increases jobless benefits to $400 a week through the end of August, expands the child tax credit to up to $3,600 per child, includes $350 billion for state and local government funding and allocates $170 billion for K-12 schools and higher education institutions to cover reopening costs. GOP lawmakers have questioned the need for another $2 trillion, accusing their liberal colleagues of using the bill as means of passing a \"Democratic wish list.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Following the House vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., accused House Democrats of bringing the \"wrong attitude\" to the coronavirus legislation. \"In 2020, Congress passed five COVID-19 rescue passages,\" McConnell said in a statement. \"All five were completely bipartisan. It was the largest peacetime fiscal expansion in American history ... because both parties had shaped the bills together and they met Americans' urgent needs.\" \"Tonight,\" he added, \"House Democrats snapped that bipartisan streak. They jammed through a bill that even liberal economsts and editorial boards say is not targeted to this stage of the fight.\" Fox Business\u2019 Megan Henney and The Associated Press contributed to this story.

Bernie Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to put the House bill on $2,000 stimulus checks up for quick consideration. That led Trump to launch a Twitter broadside against Senate Republicans, warning them that if they don't have a \u2018death wish\u2019 they'll back the boosted checks. Schumer's request would have passed the stimulus checks Tuesday afternoon. Sanders' request would have set a vote on the bill for stimulus checks Wednesday afternoon. \u2026 Notably, McConnell did not promise action on the $2,000 stimulus checks. Whether the Senate even gets to a cloture vote -- a vote to end debate and proceed to a final vote -- on the stimulus checks will be up to McConnell.\"Loeffler, Perdue back $2,000 stimulus checks as Sanders keeps pressure on - Fox News: \"Both Republican Georgia senators endorsed President Trump's push for $2,000 coronavirus stimulus checks, with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., looking to stall the Senate until it votes on the bigger payments. Sanders, though, reportedly has an ulterior motive in keeping Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue occupied in the days before their respective runoff elections. The Senate is looking to override President Trump's veto of a defense spending bill, but Sanders said he will filibuster this until they vote on whether to increase the relief payments from $600 to $2,000. The House has already agreed to do so. \u2026 By filibustering and stalling the process, Sanders could theoretically keep the Senate in Washington, D.C., during the holiday week leading to New Year's Day, which would prevent Loeffler and Perdue from campaigning in their home states before the Jan. 5 elections.\"Other Republican senators feel pressure\u00a0- Axios: \"It's still an uphill battle. But Republican senators are feeling more pressure from constituents \u2014 pumped by Trump \u2014 to do more. It could be too politically risky for some Republican senators to vote \u2018no.\u2019 If Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2018brings it to the floor, it might get 60. Then Trump can claim victory,\u2019 said a Republican source who provided a breakdown of how the vote could go. \u2018I am concerned about the debt, but working families have been hurt badly by the pandemic,\u2019 Sen.

A total of 109 Republicans, including Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a member of GOP leadership, joined with Democrats on Monday to approve the override, which would be the first of Trump\u2019s presidency. The Senate is expected to consider the measure later this week. Trump slammed GOP lawmakers on Twitter, charging that \u2018Weak and tired Republican \u2018leadership\u2019 will allow the bad Defense Bill to pass.\u2019 Trump called the override vote a \u2018disgraceful act of cowardice and total submission by weak people to Big Tech.

Fauci, described Tuesday as a surge in cases \u2018that has just gotten out of control in many respects.\u2019 Biden\u2019s remarks, planned Tuesday afternoon in Wilmington, Del., are expected to be his most extensive comments since early this month, when he laid out a plan for his first 100 days in office that included imploring all Americans to wear masks. Fauci, appearing on CNN on Tuesday morning, lamented what he expects to be a post-holiday increase in cases and the strong possibility than January\u2019s caseload will exceed even that of December. \u2018You just have to assume it\u2019s going to get worse,\u2019 Fauci said. Fauci also acknowledged that the rollout of vaccines was not reaching as many Americans as quickly as the 20 million that Trump administration had pledged by the end of the month.\"Harris emphasizes vaccine is \u2018painless\u2019 and \u2018safe\u2019 - Fox News: \"Vice President-elect Kamala Harris on Tuesday publicly took the recently approved coronavirus vaccine.

It is relatively painless, it happens really quickly. It is safe,\u2019 Harris emphasized after receiving her shot. The vice president-elect stressed, \u2018This is about saving lives. It's literally about saving lives. I trust the scientists, and it is the scientists who created and approved this vaccine everyone. So I urge everyone, when it is your turn, get vaccinated.

The Inaugural Luncheon tradition, which has been around since the late 1800s, has evolved into a three-course meal and musical performance in the Capitol\u2019s Statuary Hall for the new Cabinet, the Supreme Court and congressional leadership. The hall, however, will be quiet after this January\u2019s scaled-back inauguration, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies announced Tuesday. \u2018The health and safety of all guests attending the ceremonies has remained a top priority throughout the planning process,\u2019 Paige Waltz, the committee\u2019s communications director, said in a statement.\"2.3M EARLY BALLOTS CAST IN GEORGIA ONE WEEK OUTFox News: \"With one week to go until Election Day in Georgia, more than 2.3 million people have already voted in the state's twin Jan. 5 Senate runoff elections, with the Republican majority in the Senate at stake. The latest early voting numbers released Tuesday morning by state officials indicate that nearly a third (30.2%) of all registered voters in Georgia have already cast a ballot in the two contests. More than 1.5 million Georgians have cast a ballot through early in-person voting at polling stations that have been open for two weeks. Thursday is the last day for in-person, early voting at polling stations. Separately, more than 800,000 voters have cast an absentee ballot. With one week to go until the runoff elections, the high number of Georgians who have already voted comes close to rivaling the early turnout at this point in the November general election. A record 4.9 million voters in the state cast ballots in the general election.\"Georgia federal judge blocks voter purge in two counties - Politico: \"A federal judge in Georgia on Monday ordered two counties to reverse a decision removing more than 4,000 voters from the rolls ahead of the Jan. 5 runoff elections that will decide control of the U.S. Senate. The judge, Leslie Abrams Gardner \u2026 concluded that the counties appeared to have improperly relied on unverified change-of-address data to invalidate registrations in the two counties. The bulk of the registrations that the counties sought to rescind, more than 4,000, were in Muscogee County, which Biden won handily in November. An additional 150 were from Ben Hill County, which Trump won by a wide margin. The suit, brought by national Democratic Party attorney Marc Elias\u2019 group Majority Forward, followed an effort to challenge the lengthy roster of voters simply because their registrations appeared to match U.S. Postal Service change-of address records.\"AUDIBLE: CHECK BACK LATER \"This is a moment in which what used to be in is out and what used to be out is in.

        "text": "Games\nWashington Examiner chief congressional correspondent Susan Ferrechio says she thinks President Trump helped his chances for re-election by signing these coronavirus stimulus executive orders on Saturday because he took action in an emergency when Congress wouldn't act, which will resonate with voters. Sen. Ed Markey drew backlash from fiscal hawks like Sen. Ted Cruz on Monday after tweeting an ambitious coronavirus\u00a0stimulus plan that would involve much larger checks paid much more frequently than other proposals -- but it's hardly the first time such an idea has been floated as legislators trip over themselves to propose sweeping cash handouts to help Americans in dire financial straits during the pandemic. \"Give every person in our country $2000/month for the duration of the pandemic, $2000/month for 3 months after that, and $2000/month retroactive to March,\" Markey, D-Mass.,\u00a0tweeted, summarizing a bill\u00a0he put forward in early May. Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and\u00a0Kamala Harris, D-Calif., co-sponsored that bill with him. Politico first reported on the legislation. TRUMP SAYS SCHUMER, PELOSI 'WANT TO MEET TO MAKE A DEAL' ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF Markey's tweet was rebuked by\u00a0Cruz, R-Texas, who has been one of the fiscally conservative senators making life hard on GOP leadership in the Senate as lawmakers try to hash out some sort of agreement on a new coronavirus relief bill. From the start of the crisis, members of Congress mostly have avoided discussing the notion of how to offset the new spending. \"Why be so cheap? Give everyone $1 million a day, every day, forever. And three soy lattes a day. And a foot massage. We have a magic money tree \u2014 we should use it!\" Cruz snarked. Markey fired right back, tweeting: \"It's not a goddamn joke Ted. Millions of families are facing hunger, the threat of eviction, and the loss of their health care during a pandemic that is worsening every day. Get real.\" Markey is hardly\u00a0alone in backing sustained direct aid for Americans during the pandemic -- Cruz's Senate unanimously supported the CARES Act that previously gave $1,200 payments to Americans, and even Republicans are largely supportive of another round of payments. TED CRUZ CONDEMNS OPRAH COMMENTS ON WHITE PRIVILEGE: 'UTTER, RACIST BS' That's upset some of Cruz's conservative allies in the Senate, like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has quipped that he felt like he was in the wrong room after leaving Republican caucus lunch meetings -- saying, for example, that it was like a \"Bernie bros\" meeting. It's widely understood that many Americans need help from a government level during the crisis. The concern for some, however, is the already-skyrocketing deficit and debt. A projection by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget earlier this year, after the passage of the $2.2 trillion CARES Act, estimated the federal deficit would be $3.8 trillion in 2020 and $2.1 trillion in 2021. That is likely set to increase with another coronavirus stimulus bill, which could also cost north of $2 trillion -- Democrats have asked for about $3 trillion but Republicans are trying to negotiate that number down. The national debt is already more than $26.6 trillion. Direct payments have been popular from the beginning of the pandemic, if not at the massive scale of the Markey/Sanders/Harris proposal. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, as early as March proposed that Americans should all get a one-time, $1,000 check. Sen.

Romney was one of the first Republicans on Capitol Hill to back direct payments to Americans. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) (Associated Press) TRUMP POISED TO ADD MORE DEBT THAN OBAMA IN FIRST TERM Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.,\u00a0and Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, at about the same time proposed a one-time check that would be between $1,000 and $6,000 per American depending on need. Later, in April, the pair came out with a plan that would give $2,000 to every American over 16 per month for up to a year, and people would be able to get their money through means including Zelle, Venmo, pre-paid debit card and more. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, came forward with a more modest plan\u00a0for $1,000 per month. Eventually, the potpourri of proposals turned into a $1,200 payment for eligible Americans who were not listed as a dependent on another person's previous year's tax return and did not make more than $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for couples.\u00a0This also came with $600 boosted unemployment benefits for those who were out of work. Those benefits are now the subject of significant controversy in stimulus negotiations, as Republicans seek to keep any boosted unemployment benefits down, worried that many Americans are making more by not working than they could by working -- something that could drag down the recovery. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Trump, in a series of executive actions over the weekend, moved to provide out-of-work Americans with $400 in boosted unemployment aid, fulfilling, if temporarily, that Republican priority. And when House Democrats released a $3 trillion proposal for an additional round of stimulus in May, it included another round of checks that would pay $1,200 to each family member of a household, up to $6,000. Republicans put forward a very similar idea in their most recent coronavirus stimulus offering, and Trump has supported it as well, making direct payments a rare bipartisan point of agreement as negotiations on the legislation have flamed out, with Trump over the weekend issuing the executive actions aimed to keep Americans afloat and bring Democrats back to the table.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u00a0sparred with Lesley Stahl over stalled coronavirus\u00a0relief and admitted the Democrats held up aid for eight months in part \"because there was no\u00a0respect for our heroes,\" during a \"60 Minutes\" interview\u00a0that aired Sunday. Stahl remarked that Pelosi, D-Calif., was not \"known as a person who compromises\" after Republicans called her slow-walking \"despicable.\" \"No, I am,\" Pelosi responded.\u00a0\"I'll compromise. We wanna get the job done. I'm mischaracterized by the Republicans that way, but that's a tactic that they use. But, we know we want results for the American people.\" PELOSI GETS \u2018SHARP\u2019 WHEN ASKED ABOUT AOC DURING \u201960 MINUTES\u2019 INTERVIEW Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., holding a news conference last week. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  Stahl then brought up the $900 billion coronavirus relief package that passed in December after President-elect Joe Biden had secured the election. Pelosi said in the interview\u00a0it was stalled because of Republican obstruction. \"Yours, too,\" Stahl responded. \"No, it wasn't obstruction. ...\u00a0We held it up because there was\u00a0no respect for our heroes,\u00a0our state and local health care workers, police and fire, our first responders, our sanitation, transportation, food workers, our teachers, our teachers, our teachers. They would not go down that path,\" Pelosi said. Pelosi defended the decision to hold up the aid package, which included $600 stimulus checks, even though Stahl pointed out members of the Democratic Party called it a mistake.

But it isn't\u00a0\u2014\u00a0it wasn't a mistake, and I would not, and nobody expects me to, to support something that solidifies injustice in our country,\" Pelosi said. Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., blamed\u00a0Pelosi and her Senate counterpart Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for the better-late-than-never aid package. \"I said back in July what the\u00a0country needed was a package\u00a0roughly of a trillion dollars\u00a0focused on kids in school, small\u00a0businesses, health care\u00a0providers, and direct cash\u00a0payments,\" McConnell said in December.\u00a0\"We started advocating that in July and August. The talks were unproductive, so\u00a0I essentially put that bill on the floor of the Senate in both September and October. Not a single Democrat supported it. Their view was, give us everything we want or we won't give you anything.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It's\u00a0noteworthy\u00a0that at the end\u00a0they\u00a0finally gave us what we could\u00a0have agreed to back in July,\" he continued.\u00a0\"I think what held it up was, they did not want\u00a0to do\u00a0anything before the presidential\u00a0election.

        "text": "Games\nSen. Tom Cotton R-Ark., dissects the coronavirus stimulus bill and how it is hurting American families while helping the Washington elite. Sen. Tom Cotton R-Ark., slammed President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus bill Monday, calling it a \"payoff\"\u00a0to Democratic\u00a0Party constituencies and an example of \"the swamp\" looking after itself.\u00a0 On \"Fox & Friends,\" Cotton said that the appropriation of individual stimulus checks favors federal bureaucrats over hard-working middle-class Americans. Under the bill mandate, many Americans would receive a direct one-time\u00a0$1,400 check. However, federal employees, as long as their children's schools remain closed, would receive that same $1,400 check every single week. Additionally, the bill includes $350 billion for \"poorly-run\" states like California and New York, as well as healthcare subsidies to illegal immigrants.\u00a0 TOM COTTON AT CPAC TELLS CONSERVATIVES \u2018WE WILL NEVER RETREAT\u2019 TOM COTTON: \"One reason I think Joe Biden thinks there's no time to waste is that Democrats can see cases have plummeted since early January. They can see that we now have three effective vaccines, and vaccination rates are surging, so I think they're worried they won't have the coronavirus as an excuse to pay off all their clients and patrons in a $1.9 trillion blowout bill.  As you said, less than a dime of every dollar goes to coronavirus. Just take a look at the payoff to some of their constituencies. $350 billion for states that are poorly run and that have longstanding problems but didn't even lose money because of the coronavirus, places like California and New York\u2026  $130 billion for schools but only a nickel of each dollar of that money is going to be spent this year. Most of it is for future years. Again, paying off teachers' unions. And then maybe the worst of all, the worst of all, they're going to give a lot of Americans a $1,400 check. Federal employers are going to get that same check. They are also going to get $1,400 a week, every single week if their kids aren't in school.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So if you're working in the middle of the country, hard to make a living, you get one $1,400 payment once. If you're a federal bureaucrat in Washington where your schools are still closed, you get it every single week.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday that a fourth round of coronavirus legislation will focus on the nation's \"recovery\" and singled out\u00a0building up critical infrastructure. Pelosi said Congress\u00a0first addressed the \"emergency\" phase of the crisis with the initial\u00a0$8.3 billion package for health funding and the second bill to grant free tests and paid sick leave. Next, Congress moved to what she called the \"mitigation\" phase with the massive $2.2 trillion legislation\u00a0that passed last week to give direct payments to Americans, boost unemployment and rescue businesses, she said. TRUMP WANTS NEW INFRASTRUCTURE BILL The next phase \"will be about recovery,\" Pelosi said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"  The California Democrat said the fourth bill should include investments in infrastructure such as water systems, surface transportation and broadband access. In a pair of tweets Tuesday, President Trump said he, too, wants a \"very big and bold\" infrastructure package in the fourth coronavirus response bill and even signaled modest praise for Pelosi, saying her interview\u00a0\"wasn't bad.\" But Senate Majority\u00a0Leader Mitch McConnell remains skeptical of a\u00a0fourth round of massive government spending. \"I think we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Remember, this [third $2.2 trillion]\u00a0bill was only signed into law last Friday,\" McConnell told Hugh Hewitt Show on Tuesday, warning against Pelosi trying to achieve unrelated policy goals. \"I think first, we need to see what the effect of the current bill is,\" McConnell added. Pelosi rejected criticism that she tried to squeeze Democrat wish lists into the bills, saying \"that isn't so.\" She said proposals to help states implement\u00a0\"vote by mail\" and boosting Postal Service funding are\u00a0needed to safely\u00a0conduct elections amid the pandemic. \"I think that we've acted in a bipartisan way every step of the way and we will continue to do so,\" she said.

Treasury Secretary\u00a0Steve Mnuchin said, during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" that after weekend discussions\u00a0he remains\u00a0optimistic regarding a second coronavirus stimulus package, with Senate Republicans planning to introduce a bill\u00a0Monday --\u00a0with just\u00a0100 days before the presidential election. The bill comes as a number of benefits under the previous CARES Act bill are set to expire. SCALIA TALKS UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE NEXT CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS Mnuchin also noted that due to resistance from Democrats,\u00a0a payroll tax cut \u2013 which President Trump had hinted could be a deal-breaker for him if not included in a stimulus bill \u2013 will not be part of the current package after all. A number of Republicans were against it, as well. \u201cThat\u2019s something the president will come back and look at later in the year,\u201d Mnuchin said, claiming that direct payments to Americans \u2013 which were part of the CARES Act and are expected to be part of a new bill, as well \u2013 provide faster relief. \u201cThe direct payments are a much quicker way of effectively giving everybody a tax cut, and is much quicker than the payroll tax cut,\u201d he said. STIMULUS CHECKS, STATE AID AND MORE: WHAT\u2019S IN HOUSE DEMOCRATS' NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL Meanwhile, key parts of the CARES Act are set to expire in the near future. The Paycheck Protection Program that provides small businesses with forgivable loans, is set to end in early August, and the enhanced unemployment insurance benefits will expire on July 31. A federal eviction ban already ended on July 25. Mnuchin said that the new bill will provide additional unemployment benefits, but noted that it will be less than the payments issued under the CARES Act, because some workers were collecting more than they earned on the job. As a result, when businesses were reopening some employees did not have an incentive to return to work. Mnuchin said that upcoming unemployment benefits would be in the form of 70 percent wage replacement. \"I think workers and Americans understand the concept that you shouldn't be paid more to stay home than to work,\" he said. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Mnuchin said that the Trump administration and Senate Republicans are on the same page with a $1 trillion package, but noted that in the interest of passing a bill quickly, issues that are more difficult to negotiate with Democrats could be held off for another bill. \"This will be the fifth set of legislation, so there's no reason why we can't have number five, six, and seven as we need to deal with issues, and obviously anything we do, we need bipartisan support,\" he said.

        "text": "Games\nFox News White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on 'Special Report' Rep. Ilhan Omar,\u00a0D-Minn., and other progressive Democrats are calling this week for President Biden to commit to recurring cash payments, rather than one-off stimulus checks, to aid Americans during the coronavirus pandemic. In his \"American Rescue Plan,\" Biden asked Congress to approve a $1.9 trillion aid package that includes $1,400 direct payments for Americans. However, Omar and other progressives have argued that Biden\u2019s proposal does not go far enough to address the current financial crisis. Omar, the Congressional Progressive Caucus whip and a member of \"The Squad,\" tweeted this week that she was \"circulating a letter to Biden\" pushing for the recurring payments. In another tweet, the second-term congresswoman expressed support for Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and his call for \"recurring $2,000 checks.\" \"As the country begins to look towards building to a better future, we need to provide those struggling and left behind with consistent reliable cash payments during this COVID-19 crisis,\" Omar said in the letter, which was obtained by the Huffington Post. \"We hope that you will consider recurring cash assistance when crafting your economic policy priorities moving forward.\" Omar added that the recurring cash payments should \"continue until the economy recovers with equal payments to adults and dependents,\" among other stipulations. The letter did not detail what her proposal would cost. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Progressives have singled out Biden\u2019s call for $1,400 payments as a source of concern, arguing that the president had effectively reneged on a pledge for $2,000 checks if the Democrats won control of the Senate. Biden\u2019s defenders have pointed out the fact the president would keep his pledge since the $1,400 checks would follow a previous $600 direct payment included in the most recent aid package approved last December. Biden has identified economic aid as a top priority since taking office. The president signed two executives orders aimed at jumpstarting the economy on Friday afternoon, including a directive for his administration to begin work on his pledge to institute a $15 federal minimum wage.

Another possibility is ending the legislative filibuster, an option that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is trying to take off the table as part of a deal to run the 50-50 Senate. But Democrats have indicated they have little interest in protecting the filibuster, arguing that the threat of targeting it could force reluctant Republicans to compromise. \"It would be exactly the wrong way to begin,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.\u00a0\"We need to have the kind of position of strength that will enable us to get stuff done.\" WHAT'S IN BIDEN'S $1.9T STIMULUS PLAN? Still, Psaki said that Biden \"is no stranger to the process of dealmaking,\" and his \"clear preference\" is to strike a bipartisan deal. Biden's stimulus proposal includes $20 billion to accelerate vaccine distribution,\u00a0a $15-an-hour minimum wage increase, an extension of supplemental unemployment benefits through the end of September,\u00a0a one-time $1,400 stimulus check, a temporary expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit and $350 billion in new funding for state and local governments. While top Democrats endorsed Biden's stimulus\u00a0proposal, a number of deficit-weary Republicans have said the aid package is too expensive, foreshadowing a looming battle between lawmakers over federal spending. On Tuesday, during Janet Yellen's confirmation hearing to be Treasury secretary, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., warned Biden's plan \"would be a colossal waste and economically harmful.\" GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Democrats will control the Senate by the thinnest\u00a0of margins after twin victories by\u00a0Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in the Georgia runoff elections last\u00a0week clinched the party a 50-50 split in the upper chamber,\u00a0with Vice President Kamala Harris able to cast a tie-breaking vote.

The House Progressive Caucus on Tuesday called for the removal of Trump administration holdover officials they say are responsible for delaying the latest round of stimulus checks to 30 million Americans.\u00a0 The Democrats say Social Security Commissioner Andrew\u00a0Saul\u00a0and Deputy Commissioner David\u00a0Black must be fired for holding up the $1,400 checks that millions of Americans are counting on. IRS TO SEND STIMULUS CHECKS TO SOCIAL SECURITY RECIPIENTS THIS WEEKEND AFTER DELAY \"These Trump appointees are responsible for delaying the delivery of survival checks for 30 million Americans, mostly seniors and people living with disabilities for nearly a month,\" Progressive Caucus chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said Tuesday. \"They refuse to hand over the data to the IRS that they needed to get the checks out for weeks and they stonewalled congressional efforts.\" \"It's an egregious betrayal of their roles, which has harmed\u00a0millions of people who needed these checks to buy food and put gas in the car.\" FILE: WASHINGTON, DC - DECEMBER 09: Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) questions Intelligence Committee Minority Counsel Stephen Castor and Intelligence Committee Majority Counsel Daniel Goldman during House impeachment inquiry hearings before the House Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill December 9, 2019 in Washington, DC.(Photo by Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images)  The\u00a0IRS\u00a0said Tuesday that it will begin distributing stimulus checks to millions of\u00a0Social Security\u00a0recipients and other lower-income Americans\u00a0this weekend. The majority of the payments will be sent electronically and will arrive by Wednesday, April 7, the agency said. IRS STILL PROCESSING STIMULUS CHECKS FOR LOW-INCOME AMERICANS - HERE'S WHY The announcement comes after House Democrats last week sounded the alarm over delays in the delivery\u00a0of the third round of cash payments\u00a0to\u00a0Americans who are not required to\u00a0file\u00a0tax\u00a0returns -- including some veterans and\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries. The lawmakers blamed Saul -- who was nominated by former President Donald Trump -- for the delays, which they said defied congressional intent and imposed needless anxiety on\u00a0taxpayers. Saul, in a statement Thursday night, attributed the delay to a\u00a0lack of funding\u00a0and political red tape that prevented the administration from working with the Treasury Department or IRS before the American Rescue Plan was passed. REPUBLICANS FORM CONSERVATIVE COALITION TO FIGHT BIDEN'S TAX HIKES IN $3T INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT The\u00a0Social Security\u00a0Administration (SSA) sent the\u00a0missing files\u00a0for about 30 million people to the IRS on Thursday, and the agency subsequently began the \"multi-step process to review, validate and test tens of millions of records to ensure eligibility and proper calculation\" of the check. A spokesperson for Biden did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment about whether he intends to fire the Trump holdovers and appoint new leadership.\u00a0 The $1,400 checks were part of Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief legislation that he signed into law on March 11.

        "text": "Games\nThe head of the Government Accountability Office (GAO) told lawmakers Friday that the IRS knew it was sending out stimulus payments to dead people -- and even said that his own mother, who died in 2018, received one. \u201cWhat happened was: IRS initially determined that deceased people, or anybody who filed a return in 2018 or 2019 should be paid, so they knew they were paying people who were deceased,\u201d Comptroller Gene Dodaro told the House select committee on the coronavirus crisis. \u201cThen it became known publicly,\u00a0Treasury then reevaluated that position and stopped it.\u201d FEDS SENT NEARLY $1.4 BILLION IN STIMULUS MONEY TO DEAD PEOPLE, REPORT FINDS Dodaro testified a day after a GAO report was published that found that more than a million economic stimulus payments, totaling nearly $1.4 billion were sent out to people who were deceased. Gene L. Dodaro, comptroller general of the United States, wears a face mask as he waves to members of a House Select Subcommittee on Capitol Hill in Washington, Friday, June 26, 2020, before the start of a hearing about a new report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) with recommendations to improve the federal coronavirus response. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)  The report, which looked at how the nearly $3 trillion CARES Act stimulus package was administered, said that the IRS typically uses third-party data such as death records maintained by the Social Security Administration to prevent erroneous tax refund claims. But with the economic stimulus checks sent out in April and May in response to the COVID-19 crisis, the Treasury Department and the IRS \u201cdid not use the death records to stop payments to deceased individuals for the first three batches of payments because of the legal interpretation under which IRS was operating.\u201d IRS counsel reportedly \u201cdetermined that IRS did not have the legal authority to deny payments to those who filed a return for 2019, even if they were deceased at the time of payment.\u201d It also advised \u201cdiscretion\u201d provided for in the CARES Act (which authorized the payments) to apply the same set of rules to those who filed a 2018 return but not one in 2019. Treasury officials also cited language in the CARES Act that demanded the payments be made as \u201crapidly as possible\u201d as to why Treasury and IRS used policies and procedures developed in 2008 for stimulus payments, and consequently \u201cdid not use the death records as a filter to halt payments to decedents in the first three batches of payments\u201d in an effort to fulfill that mandate from Congress. Dodaro said that in order to stop the payments, the Treasury had to give Treasury's Bureau of\u00a0Fiscal Service, which makes the payments, temporary access to a death master file. He said he has urged Congress to pass legislation giving it permanent access to the file. TRUMP HINTS AT 'GENEROUS' SECOND CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS CHECK. HERE'S HOW MUCH YOU COULD\u00a0GET He went on to say that even his own mother, who died more than two years ago, received a payment. \u201cMy own mother received a payment, she unfortunately passed away in February 2018, and my sister got it on behalf of my mother and right on the check it said deceased,\u201d he said, adding that the payment was returned. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Dodaro said that since the report came out, a number of citizens have emailed saying they have checks that were mistakenly sent and are looking to return them. He renewed his calls for Congress to pass a legislative fix to the problem. \u201cCongress needs to pass this legislation. ... I think its very important,\u201d he said, arguing that it could affect other government payments too. \u201cIt could be payment for agriculture, education or whatever, so I'd encourage you to do that.\u201d Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox Subscribed You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92025 FOX News Network, LLC.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Republicans are eyeing a new targeted coronavirus relief bill based on what President Trump would sign into law, and poured cold water on a new bipartisan $908 billion proposal his colleagues put forth earlier Tuesday. \"We just don't have time to waste time,\" McConnell, R-Ky., said of the compromise\u00a0legislation a group of Democrats and Republicans released Tuesday. \"We have a couple of weeks left here. Obviously, it does require bipartisan support to get out of Congress, but it requires a\u00a0presidential signature. And this government is in place for sure for the next month.\u00a0And I think the place to start is: Are we actually making a law or are we just making a point?\" McConnell\u00a0said he talked with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to ascertain exactly what Trump would sign into law. That proposal -- pegged at roughly $500 billion -- was circulated to Senate Republicans Tuesday and will be the basis of the next GOP COVID relief effort.\u00a0 BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS UNVEIL $908B CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PROPOSAL AMID GRIDLOCK A copy of the proposal obtained by Fox News shows the legislation includes liability protections for businesses, more than $300 billion in new Paycheck Protection Program money for employers, $105 billion for schools to reopen and an extension of unemployment benefits through Jan. 31 with a two-month phase-out. Not included in the legislation is another round of direct stimulus checks of $1,200, rental assistance or state and local funding.\u00a0 The timeline for the coronavirus relief bill is around the corner. Government funding ends on Dec. 11 at 11:59 p.m., and Congress must pass a new spending bill to avert another shutdown. McConnell said the $1.4 trillion omnibus\u00a0spending bill could be the \"vehicle\" to add on the latest coronavirus relief legislation. \"I think it all might become one package,\" McConnell said.\u00a0\u00a0 BIDEN CALLS FOR ERASING SOME STUDENT LOAN DEBT, FACES PROGRESSIVE PRESSURE TO GO FURTHER Meanwhile, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., blasted McConnell for the \"partisan\" approach and urged the majority leader to work with Democrats.\u00a0 Schumer and\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sent McConnell a new offer Monday night to get the ball moving on bipartisan talks. The details of their offer were not made public. \"The\u00a0biggest impediment to getting an\u00a0agreement is the\u00a0Republican leader refusing to negotiate in a bipartisan way,\" Schumer\u00a0said. \"He knows darn well the House is a Democratic majority. He knows darn well\u00a0he needs Democratic votes in the Senate ... and yet he continues to negotiate in a partisan way.\" Earlier Tuesday the House Problem Solvers Caucus and a bipartisan group of senators\u00a0released their joint plan for coronavirus\u00a0relief in an effort to bridge the gap\u00a0and find common ground. 12 MILLION AMERICANS FACE LOSS OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS \"It won't make everyone happy,\" Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., said during a press conference on Tuesday. \"But there's been an enormous\u00a0amount of work done.\" Their $908 billion bipartisan agreement allocates about\u00a0$300 billion in funding for small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program, $240 billion in aid for state and local governments, $180 billion to extend boosted unemployment benefits at $300 per week for four months and a temporary moratorium on COVID liability lawsuits to allow states enough time to design their own laws. It notably does not include a second stimulus check. Mike Emanuel and Megan Henney\u00a0contributed to this report.\u00a0 Marisa Schultz is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital.

        "text": "Games\nFox News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram breaks down the 'messy' legislating to come to get the Democrats' bill to the finish line. President Biden cheered the passage Saturday of his $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill in the Senate and said the massive stimulus is the key to ending the suffering caused by\u00a0the yearlong pandemic.\u00a0 \"Today, I can say we've taken one more giant step forward in delivering on that promise that help is on the way,\" Biden said in remarks at the White House. Biden's victory lap was a bit premature since the House still needs to pass the Senate version of the legislation on Tuesday. Progressives in the House have raised concerns about changes to the bill that eliminate\u00a0the $15 minimum federal wage, lower\u00a0weekly unemployment benefits from $400 to $300, and limit\u00a0income eligibility for stimulus checks. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., can only afford to\u00a0lose four votes\u00a0and still send the bill\u00a0to Biden's desk for his first major legislative win. Biden is confident the\u00a0House will pass the\u00a0legislation and downplayed any concern among progressives,\u00a0noting that Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., supported the bill.\u00a0 BERNIE SANDERS AMENDMENT FOR $15 MINIMUM WAGE FAILS IN SENATE IN LONGEST VOTE IN HISTORY \"They\u2019re not frustrated,\" he said in response to a question about progressives' concerns. \"As Bernie Sanders said, this is the most progressive bill he's ever seen pass since he's been here.\" He also brushed off\u00a0the lack of any GOP support in the Senate or House, and said he hasn't given up on\u00a0working with Republicans on future legislation.\u00a0 \"I'm going to succeed,\" Biden said when asked about the tone this legislation sets for the next four years. President Biden speaks at the White House on Saturday, March 6, 2021.  Biden touted the relief provisions in the bill, including unemployment benefits,\u00a0food aid, vaccination distribution support and the $1,400 stimulus payments. He\u00a0told Americans they'd be seeing those checks soon. \"This plan will get checks out the door starting this month to the American people,\" Biden said.\u00a0 Biden took a veiled jab\u00a0at former President Donald Trump, saying that for the last year\u00a0the American people were told they were on their own. \"When I was elected, I said we were\u00a0going to get the government out of the business of battling on Twitter and back in the business of delivering for\u00a0the American people,\" Biden said.\u00a0 SENATE NARROWLY PASSES COVID RELIEF BILL AFTER SLEEPLESS, TUMULTUOUS NIGHT Biden said Democrats are delivering on the promise to relieve the suffering caused by the pandemic.\u00a0 \"The bottom line is this:\u00a0This plan puts us on a path to beating the virus,\" Biden said.\u00a0 Biden was slated to travel home to\u00a0Wilmington, Del., this weekend, but instead stayed in Washington to deliver remarks at the White House after the COVID bill passed the Senate. KAMALA HARRIS CASTS TIE-BREAKING VOTE TO LAUNCH DEBATE OVER $1.9 TRILLION COVID-19 BILL Biden gave thanks to\u00a0Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., for ushering in the narrow 50-49 passage after a marathon, 27-hour session. \"When the country needed you most,\u00a0you led Chuck, and you delivered,\" Biden said.\u00a0 The president also thanked the American people for supporting the legislation in public opinion polling and said that pressure helped the passage.\u00a0 \"Quite frankly, without the overwhelming, bipartisan support of the American people, this would not have happened,\" Biden said.\u00a0 \"Look, the American people strongly support what we\u2019re doing here, \" Biden added. \"That\u2019s the key here.\" The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u00a0found this week\u00a0that Biden's coronavirus bill\u00a0would add $1.862 trillion to the national deficit over 10 years, with the bulk of the new spending -- $1.173 trillion -- occurring in fiscal year\u00a02021. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The federal government ran an annual\u00a0deficit of $3.1 trillion in the 2020 fiscal year, more than triple the deficit of the previous year, according to the\u00a0Bipartisan Policy Center.

TEXAS REPUBLICAN: PROCESS ON COROANVIRUS RELIEF BILL WAS DISGRACE TO TAXPAYERS Trump argued that the relief bill in its current form, which is included with\u00a0$1.4 trillion in omnibus spending,\u00a0has \"almost nothing to do with COVID.\" \"Congress found plenty of money for foreign countries, lobbyists\u00a0and special interests\u00a0while sending the bare minimum to the American people who need it,\" Trump said. He noted that small businesses,\u00a0particularly restaurants, have not been given enough money after their owners have \"suffered so grievously.\" \"They were only given a deduction for others to use in business, their restaurant, for two years,\" Trump added. \"This two year period must be withdrawn, which will allow the owners to obtain financing and get their restaurants back in condition. Congress can terminate it\u00a0at a much later date, but two years is not acceptable it's not enough.\" The package includes increased jobless benefits, another round of funding for the Paycheck Protection Program for\u00a0small business loans, a direct payment of $600 to individuals, and funds to help distribute COVID-19 vaccines. BIDEN SAYS 'OUR DARKEST DAYS WITH COVID ARE AHEAD OF US, NOT BEHIND US' The president warned that if the \"wasteful and unnecessary items\" are not removed from the legislation, the next administration will have to deliver a COVID-19 relief package. \"Maybe that administration will be me,\" Trump added. \"And we will get it done.\" Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, responded to Trump's request in a tweet, arguing\u00a0that Democrats \"spent months trying to secure $2000 checks but Republicans blocked it.\" \"Trump needs to sign the bill to help people and keep the government open and we're glad to pass more aid Americans need,\" Schumer added. \"Maybe Trump can finally make himself useful and get Republicans not to block it again.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Republicans \"repeatedly refused to say what amount the President wanted for direct checks,\" and applauded the president for pushing for more money to be included in stimulus checks to the American people.\u00a0 \"At last the President has agreed to $2,000,\" Pelosi wrote. \"Let's do it!\" Pelosi added\u00a0that Democrats would be ready to bring an amendemnt to a vote\u00a0this week by \"unanimous consent.\"\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sen.

        "text": "Games\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., reacted to President Trump calling the coronavirus relief bill a 'disgrace.' The recently passed coronavirus stimulus package was hijacked by House Democrats to pave a \"pathway to socialism,\" Sen. Marsha Blackburn,\u00a0R-Tenn.,\u00a0said\u00a0Wednesday.\u00a0 \"I think it is fair to say that President Trump fully understands the best economic stimulus is a job, and there is a lot in this bill that gets in the way of economic recovery,\" Blackburn told \"America\u2019s Newsroom.\" Trump blasted the bill on Tuesday night and called for Congress to remove pork from the stimulus and increase direct payments to $2,000 for Americans. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who also voted against it, called for Trump to veto it, although he opposed Trump's call for higher direct payments. \"The bill is an insult to injury for millions of Americans who are still out of work and still need relief,\" Blackburn said. \"And the president is right about this. The priorities are wrong, and the Democrats'\u00a0priority is power and control. It is not about helping people, which is what we have tried to do for months.\" Blackburn, one of six Republican senators to vote against the stimulus,\u00a0called for \"targeted relief\" in the coronavirus bill. \"If\u00a0this was about getting more money to individuals who are unemployed, the Democrats could have voted for this when we had it on the floor in July or September or twice in October, in November. They voted no. It would have made a difference,\" she said.

Bill Cassidy, R-La., accused President Biden of abandoning true unity for a \"patina of unity\" and said the president failed to reach out to his group of bipartisan centrist senators before releasing his\u00a0$1.9 trillion coronavirus stimulus proposal earlier in January.

(Ashlee Rezin Garcia/Chicago Sun-Times via AP, Pool File)  Cassidy said the senators' proposal matches Biden's $160 billion pledge to fund vaccinations and includes $20 billion \"to get kids back to school.\" Cassidy and his fellow Senate Republicans Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah, Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Todd Young of Indiana, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina sent Biden a letter on Sunday. \"In the spirit of bipartisanship and unity, we have developed a COVID-19 relief framework that builds on prior COVID assistance laws, all of which passed with bipartisan support,\" they wrote. \"Our proposal reflects many of your stated priorities, and with your support, we believe that this plan could be approved quickly by Congress with bipartisan support.\" BIDEN PICK TO RUN UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAM OVERSAW $600M IN LOSSES TO NIGERIAN FRAUD SCHEME: REPORT Cassidy said direct coronavirus relief payments need to be more targeted. \"Above a certain income level, that money's not spent ... doesn't stimulate the economy,\" he said.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. \u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d said White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Fox News about the possibility of a coronavirus deal. \u201cWe have tried very hard to narrow the gap. Very hard. But we just can\u2019t leap the hurdles of policy disagreements.\u201d Kudlow conceded it would be \u201cvery hard to get it done before the election.\u201d This is a negotiation which started back in July. Pressure mounted in early August. Talks went dark for a while. Then intensified in the middle of September. That\u2019s because layoffs loomed in October. Extra unemployment benefits expired in July. The sides believed they had an opportunity to forge a deal before the election. A coalition of Democrats and Republicans pressured House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to cut a smaller deal with the administration. DEMOCRATIC SWEEP WOULDN'T GUARANTEE MORE CORONAVIRUS RELIEF Pelosi spoke nearly every day with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for weeks. President Trump dithered about what he wanted. He said first no bill. The president attempted to end negotiations \u2013 but Mnuchin didn\u2019t listen. Trump then declared he wanted to spend more than even Pelosi. Mnuchin went to Senate Republicans with a $1.8 trillion proposal. They flat-out rejected that. That\u2019s a retrospective of where we are today on a coronavirus deal. And while there\u2019s no deal, Pelosi and Mnuchin spoke yet again on Monday. More than 8.2 million seconds have bled off Kudlow\u2019s clock since these discussions began. And now there is simply no way to get a coronavirus deal before the election. Perhaps there never was. The gaps were too wide. Politico\u2019s Jake Sherman posed the most simple, yet important questions at Pelosi\u2019s press conference late last week. \u201cHave you come to an agreement on state and local funding?\u201d asked Sherman. PELOSI 'REMAINS OPTIMISTIC' ABOUT COVID-19 RELIEF PACKAGE BEFORE ELECTION DAY \u201cNo,\u201d replied the speaker. Sherman followed up. \u201cAnd on liability?\u201d he asked. That\u2019s a reference to special liability protections Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says are essential for a coronavirus bill. \u201cNo, we haven\u2019t,\u201d answered the speaker. That exchange crystallizes the entire problem. There was never an agreement on a topline spending figure. And, they never settled the most nettlesome policy issues in the negotiation: how much to spend on state and local governments and a potential agreement on if people could sue over the pandemic. Still, a weird nebula of optimism encased the talks last week. \u201cThe negotiations have entered a new phase,\u201d bragged White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on FOX Business last week. \u201cWe\u2019re still far apart. Still a number of issues to work on. But the last 24 hours have moved the ball down the field.\u201d \u201cWe are committed to getting a stimulus package. This is the best we\u2019ve felt about it to date,\u201d bragged White House Communications Director Alyssa Farah. Pelosi sprinkled the word \u201coptimistic\u201d into a number of media interviews she did as well. But few bought it. Meadows visited Capitol Hill to speak with Republican senators last week. There really wasn\u2019t any movement among GOP senators who could only support a bill of a few hundred billion dollars \u2013 or do nothing at all. \u201cMaybe he just needed to get out of the White House,\u201d suggested Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., of Meadows. A senior Congressional Republican source characterized all of the chatter about optimism as \u201chappy talk.\u201d PELOSI SAYS 'WE'RE JUST ABOUT THERE' ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF DEAL, BUT KEY HANG-UPS REMAIN Other congressional sources wondered aloud if things really were inching in the right direction. Or, if this was just another fa\u00e7ade? Pelosi imposed a deadline of last Tuesday to get a deal. But then they continued talking. The idea was that they had to have the details nailed down by last Tuesday so they could get legislative language settled by last Friday. Only a timetable that strict would allow the House (and, perhaps, only the House), to move a prospective bill before Election Day. But some aides doubted that Pelosi needed the deal frozen in form late last week to get anything done. One source observed that the sides exchanged so much paper that quickly translating provisions into legislative language wouldn\u2019t take long. Fox was told by multiple Congressional sources this was an effort \u2013 by both sides, to give the appearance they are trying to get a deal just before the election. That would appeal to voters on both sides. Moreover, such continued talks, day in and day out, continue to buoy the market. \u201cCan you imagine if they came out and said they didn\u2019t have a deal?\u201d said one Congressional source who asked not to be named. \u201cWhat would that do to the election? What would it do to stocks? What would that do to the economy?\u201d One factor in this process remained unmovable: Election Day. It was always likely the election would help settle this dispute. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do it this year, it\u2019s now or never,\u201d said Blunt. \u201cI think the lame duck [Congress]\u00a0is a really hard time to get much done \u2013 in any lame duck. I don\u2019t see why this one would be different.\u201d That means nothing could move until January. It\u2019s a misnomer that leaders can seemingly pry loose intractable issues in a lame duck session of Congress. But that\u2019s rarely the case. The members who were reluctant to go along before suddenly don\u2019t lose their political convictions just because they got reelected. Or are retiring. Or lost. Positions don\u2019t change. Second of all, divides exist between the president and Republicans. President Trump doesn\u2019t have a lot of capital among Senate GOPers these days. That could change if Trump wins reelection. But, if the president loses, he really lacks much traction with reluctant Senate Republicans. This is to say nothing of private criticism shared with Fox News\u00a0 by both GOP lawmakers and aides who have no idea what exactly Mnuchin was negotiating or if they could agree to anything he negotiated with Pelosi. In Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cReady Player One,\u201d video game players are on a quest to find three keys buried within the \u201cOasis,\u201d a vast, beautiful virtual reality. But after five years of searching, no one located even a single key. That led some to question whether the keys even existed. Or, if this was just a big, digital, wild goose chase. It turns out the keys were real in the movie. But it took a long time to find them. It may be unclear whether the pursuit of a big coronavirus bill is a wild goose chase. Or, like some wondered in \u201cReady Player One,\u201d if the keys were ever real. One thing\u2019s for sure. The clock has been ticking. And if the keys to a coronavirus agreement are real, it\u2019s taking a long time to find them. Chad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).

        "text": "Games\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hold a bill enrollment ceremony at the Capitol on March 10, 2021, after Congress passes President Biden's first major piece of legislation. The House of Representatives Wednesday finalized a massive $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill that will head to President Biden's desk for his first legislative victory. The vote was 220 to 211 in the House. No Republicans voted \"yes\" on the legislation that Democrats say is needed to crush the pandemic, rebuild the economy and to lift children out of poverty.\u00a0 \"The American people have been calling on us to deliver relief\u00a0and to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., the chair of the House\u00a0Committee on Education and Labor that helped author\u00a0the legislation. \"Today we come together to send a resounding\u00a0message that help is on the way.\" The bill means more money in Americans' pockets is on the horizon. The \"American Rescue Plan\" calls for $1,400 stimulus checks for individuals earning up to $75,000\u00a0and $2,800 checks for couples earning $150,000 or under. Households will receive an additional $1,400 for each dependent child.\u00a0 THIRD STIMULUS CHECK: WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE MONEY, AND WHO ISN'T? For the unemployed, the legislation extends $300-per-week enhanced federal benefits\u00a0through Sept. 6 and allows the first $10,200 of\u00a0jobless benefits to be tax-free to households with incomes under $150,000. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., signs the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, accompanied by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., during an enrollment ceremony on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, March 10, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (AP) And unlike past coronavirus relief bills, this legislation establishes a \"child allowance\" worth upwards of $300 per month\u00a0for each child under the age of six, or $3,600 a year. For older children up to age 17, families would get $3,000 a year\u00a0in the new\u00a0child tax credit program. BIDEN'S CORONAVIRUS BILL INCLUDES NEW 'CHILD ALLOWANCE' PAYMENTS TO PARENTS Democrats dubbed the legislation\u00a0historic and \"transformative.\" They said the expanded benefits are targeted to families who suffered the most under the national pandemic that has killed more than 500,000 Americans\u00a0and will help lift millions of children out of poverty as a result. \"Help is here,\" Biden tweeted after the bill's passage. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., compared the magnitude of Biden's coronavirus bill to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as ObamaCare. \"The American Rescue plan is a force for fairness and justice in America,\" Pelosi said prior to the vote.\u00a0\"This legislation is one of the most transformative and historic bills any of us will ever have the opportunity to support.\" Biden had hoped his landmark plan to end the pandemic and revive the economy would garner bipartisan support. But\u00a0unlike the previous rounds of coronavirus relief that Republicans widely\u00a0supported under former President Trump, no Republican signed onto Biden's bill. One Democrat voted against the legislation,\u00a0Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, who had concerns with \"the overall size and scope of the bill.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., signs the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill, accompanied by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., during an enrollment ceremony on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, March 10, 2021, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (AP) No progressives voted against the bill, despite raising concerns the Senate watered down the legislation too much by eliminating the $15 minimum wage hike, lowering income eligibility for the stimulus checks and reducing the weekly unemployment checks to $300, down from $400 per week in the House version.\u00a0 Republicans said the legislation was unnecessary, too big and filled with unrelated liberal priorities, such as $350 billion for state and local governments. \"Why would we print and borrow $2 trillion when we're so close to crushing this virus and returning to a way of life that all Americans sacrificed?\" asked\u00a0Rep.\u00a0Lloyd Smucker, R-Penn. GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., added: \"This isn\u2019t a rescue bill. It isn\u2019t a relief bill. It\u2019s a laundry list of leftwing priorities that predate the pandemic and do not meet the needs of American families.\" SENATE NARROWLY PASSES COVID RELIEF BILL AFTER SLEEPLESS, TUMULTUOUS NIGHT In addition to the direct payments, the legislation also includes an expanded benefit to parents paying for child care worth up to $8,000 in a refundable tax credit. Other provisions of the bill include\u00a0hundreds of billions for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, schools, food programs, rental assistance\u00a0and ailing industries from airlines to concert halls. There is aid for farmers of color and pension systems, and subsidies for\u00a0consumers buying health insurance\u00a0and states expanding Medicaid coverage for lower earners. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found last week that 70% of Americans back Biden\u2019s response to the virus, including a hefty 44% of Republicans. PELOSI COMPARES 'TRANSFORMATIVE' CORONAVIRUS LEGISLATION TO SCOPE OF OBAMACARE Democrats pointed to the popularity of the legislation among\u00a0the American public and accused the GOP of suddenly being resistant to coronavirus aid they supported in the past just because Trump is no longer in the White House. \"The time for action is now,\" said Rep.\u00a0Steven Horsford, D-Nev. \"And if Republicans won't help us crush the coronavirus. We'll do it without them.\" Biden is expected to sign the bill into law at the White House on\u00a0Friday.\u00a0 The Associated Press contributed to this report.\u00a0 Marisa Schultz is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital.

The House of Representatives\u00a0on Friday evening passed a $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill, the most expensive legislation approved by that body in history, that Democrats hailed as the unprecedented response needed to deal with the\u00a0pandemic and its economic fallout. The record-breaking bill narrowly passed by a 208-199 vote. Fourteen Democrats defied their party and voted \"no,\"\u00a0while one Republican, Rep.

We couldn\u2019t be more thrilled.\" HOUSE DEMS UNVEIL CORONAVIRUS BILL ESTIMATED TO COST $3T, IN LARGEST STIMULUS PACKAGE YET\u00a0 Unlike the first four coronavirus bills, which were passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, this 1,815-page package\u00a0was drafted by Democrats alone and earned\u00a0a veto threat from the White House and condemnation from the GOP as a \"liberal wish list\" that's dead on arrival in the Senate. Even Pelosi couldn't get all her members on board. The most liberal members of the party panned the legislation as not going big enough, while moderate members in swing districts said they couldn't support a bill that was too partisan and costly. \"At a time when our country is in real trouble, we should not be spending precious time on one-sided solutions that aren\u2019t going anywhere,\"\u00a0said Rep. Joe Cunningham, D-S.C. The 14 Democrats voting \"no\" were Cunningham and Reps. Cindy Axne of Iowa, Sharice Davids of Kansas, Abby Finkenauer of Iowa, Jared Golden of Maine, Kendra Horn of Oklahoma, Pramila Jayapal of Washington,\u00a0Conor Lamb of Pennsylvania, \u00a0Elaine Luria of Virginia, Ben McAdams of Utah, Kurt Schrader of Oregon, Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Xochitl Torres Small of New Mexico and\u00a0Susan Wild of Pennsylvania. DEFECTIONS IN THE HOUSE: SEVERAL DEMS TO VOTE 'NO' ON $3T CORONAVIRUS BILL But most Democrats, some making emotional pleas\u00a0on the House floor, said Americans need this\u00a0lifeline -- now. They spoke of the more than 85,000 deaths from COVID-19, winding lines at food banks\u00a0in their districts, more than\u00a036 million filing for unemployment, and families struggling to make rent as evidence of the need for a historic response. \"Many say this bill is dead on arrival,\"\u00a0Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., told members on the House floor.\u00a0\"If we do not move this bill, the deaths will be in our districts.\" Dubbed the HEROES Act, the legislation includes $915 billion in state and local aid that could prevent layoffs of public workers, like first responders and teachers; a new $200 billion \"heroes\" fund for hazard pay for essential workers;\u00a0$100 billion for K-12 and higher education and $75 billion for coronavirus testing. The legislation aims to get more money into the pockets of Americans\u00a0hard-hit by\u00a0widespread business closures. Eligible individuals\u00a0would receive $1,200 checks for each person in their household, up to $6,000. STIMULUS CHECKS, STATE AID AND MORE: WHAT\u2019S IN HOUSE DEMOCRATS' NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL The bill extends add-on unemployment benefits of $600\u00a0in addition to state benefits\u00a0through January 2021, creates a special enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act exchanges for the uninsured and provides $175 billion for families to\u00a0pay their mortgages and rent. The legislation includes student loan forgiveness, an employee retention tax credit and increases\u00a0maximum SNAP benefits\u00a0by 15 percent. But tucked into the legislation are provisions that rankled the Republicans, including expanding $1,200 checks to certain undocumented immigrants, restoring the full State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT) that helps individuals in high-taxed blue states, a $25 billion rescue\u00a0for the U.S. Postal Service, allowing legal marijuana businesses to access banking services and early voting and vote-by-mail provisions. DEMOCRATS' $3T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL IS TOO SMALL FOR SOME PROGRESSIVES \"So much of what's in this bill simply has nothing at all to do with the current crisis,\" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. \"It's more like a liberal Christmas ... wish list. It would make more sense ...\u00a0to just send it straight to Santa Claus than to send\u00a0it to the United States Senate. It would have a better chance of becoming law that way.\" Acknowledging this bill won't get passed in the GOP-led Senate,\u00a0Democrats framed the HEROS Act as their opening offer for negotiations. Democrat leadership said bipartisan legislation\u00a0wasn't an option\u00a0because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell wanted to put the brakes on any new relief bill and suggested that states be given the option of declaring bankruptcy. HOUSE PASSES PLAN FOR PROXY VOTING, DESPITE GOP OBJECTIONS Pelosi, D-Calif., hit back on critics who say now is\u00a0the time to \"take a pause\" on more spending and that the bill is bloated with liberal goodies. \"This is not a Christmas tree, there's nothing joyful about this,\" Pelosi said. \"This is a very strategically planned piece of legislation.\" Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chided members who she said pay lip service to first responders and heroes but don\u2019t back it up with money. \u201cPut up or shut up,\u201d Waters told her colleagues. \u201cNow is the time to do it.\u201d The atmosphere at the Capitol Friday reflected the health risks of the global pandemic. Many members and staff wore face masks. Lawmakers wiped down surfaces after they made speeches on the House floor. And voting took more than an hour as members were brought into the chamber in alphabetical waves to practice social distancing. Despite Friday's fractured vote, lawmakers on both sides\u00a0expressed optimism that they\u00a0could find some bipartisan agreement in the future. MCCONNELL PREDICTS 'HIGH LIKELIHOOD' OF NEW STIMULUS BILL, DISMISSES DEM PROPOSAL AS 'PARADE OF ABSURDITIES' \"We've proven that we can work together. We did for four straight bills,\" Cole said, referring to the nearly $3 trillion in aid Congress already passed. \"...

        "text": "Games\nGood morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start\u00a0your day ... Congress passes $900B COVID-19 bill after fiery speech in opposition by Sen. Rand PaulSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., addressed the Senate prior to his colleagues' vote on a $900 billion coronavirus package and told his fellow Republicans who backed the stimulus they are no better than the Democrats they criticize who align themselves with socialism. Late Monday evening, the House approved the measure by a 359-53 vote. The Senate\u00a0then followed suit, approving the measure by a 92-6 tally, sending the legislation to President Trump's desk for his signature. \"To so-called conservatives who are quick to identify the socialism of Democrats: If you vote for this spending monstrosity, you are no better,\" Paul said. The relief package will send a $600 direct stimulus payment to most Americans, along with a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants and theaters. \"If free money was the answer... if money really did grow on trees, why not give more free money?\" he said. \"Why not give it out all the time? Why stop at $600 a person? Why not $1,000? Why not $2,000? Maybe these new Free-Money Republicans should join the Everybody-Gets-A-Guaranteed-Income Caucus? Why not $20,000 a year for everybody, why not $30,000? If we can print out money with impunity, why not do it?\" Paul targeted his own colleagues who voted for the bill and said, \"When you vote to pass out free money, you lose your soul and you abandon forever any semblance of moral or fiscal integrity.\" He instead called on colleagues to open the economy, cut obvious waste in the budget and stop piling on debt for future generations.

Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., attended the White House meeting and said there's growing support for GOP lawmakers from the House and Senate to challenge the election results when a Joint Session of Congress convenes on Jan. 6 to certify the Electoral College result. The vote was 306 to 232 in Biden's favor.  \"We will be raising objections to the Electoral College votes for Joe Biden for multiple states,\" Greene told Fox News.Greene said the White House meeting including Trump, Vice President Pence, Trump's legal team and about 15 House members,\u00a0including GOP Reps.

        "text": "Games\nCongress is stuck repeating the same thing over and over again each day; Chad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill. The Trump administration\u00a0is eyeing an opportunity to pass a slimmed-down coronavirus aid package in coming days as House lawmakers return to Washington for a vote on Postal Service funding, according to a top White House official. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, while speaking to\u00a0reporters on Wednesday, suggested the two sides are closer\u00a0to cutting\u00a0a bipartisan relief deal\u00a0after Speak Nancy Pelosi called back the House for a rare Saturday vote on a bill\u00a0that would provide $25 billion\u00a0to the\u00a0U.S. Postal Service. \u201cI think the outlook for a skinny deal is better than it\u2019s ever been, and yet we are still not there,\u201d Meadows told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cIf Speaker\u00a0Pelosi moves forward a single bill on postal ... let\u2019s add in the things we can agree upon.\u201d Senate\u00a0Republicans\u00a0plan to renew the push for an agreement between the two sides this week with the introduction of a smaller aid package. WASHINGTON IMPASSE ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF THREATENS US ECONOMY The smaller GOP\u00a0relief bill is expected to include $300 in extra weekly federal unemployment benefits until December 27, another round\u00a0of money for the Paycheck Protection Program and an additional $10 billion for the U.S. Postal Service and liability protections, according to\u00a0Politico, citing two GOP sources. The proposal would also allocate additional funding for schools and education. The revised measure would\u00a0represent a scaled-back version of the $1 trillion HEALS Act introduced by Republicans at the end of July. But the new proposal\u00a0notably does not include a second $1,200 stimulus check for American families, unlike the HEALS Act. One of the biggest points of contention between the parties is the cost of the proposal. Democrats have offered to come down $1 trillion from the roughly $3 trillion package the House passed in May. But the White House and Republican leaders want to keep the price tag closer to $1 trillion\u00a0amid growing concerns over the nation's growing\u00a0deficit. Meadows suggested that White House officials and \u00a0Democratic.leaders could pass a deal on \"things that we can agree upon\" -- including funding for schools, the Paycheck Protection Program and \"maybe even the stimulus checks\" --\u00a0before focusing on other, more divisive measures. SECOND STIMULUS CHECK MAY NOT GO OUT UNTIL SEPTEMBER AS RELIEF TALKS DRAG ON Pelosi seemed to indicate support for a pared-down bill on Tuesday during a Politico Playbook event. \u201cWe\u2019re willing to cut our bill in half to meet the needs right now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll take it up again in January.\" However, her\u00a0spokesperson later said that she was referring to Democrats' previous $2 trillion offer to meet Republicans halfway, \"not cutting our bill in half,\" according to Bloomberg News. Still, Pelosi said the negotiators \"have to try to come to that agreement now.\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., predicted on Wednesday the two sides would work together to reach a deal after the Republican National Convention next week, with a deal possible after Labor Day. \"I actually think there is going to be some motive to really get down to the brass tacks right after the Republican convention,\" Kaine told Politico. \"It was clear the White House, for some reason, they wanted to go into their convention blaming Democrats.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Senate is slated\u00a0to return from recess on Sept. 8 and the House on Sept. 14.

The co-founder of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity and\u00a0member of President Trump\u2019s economic recovery task force told \"The Daily Briefing\" that he does not support the administration's push to increase direct stimulus payments from $600 to $2,000 -- something\u00a0Trump\u00a0and House\u00a0Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0have fiercely supported. MCCONNELL AGAIN BLOCKS QUICK VOTE OF $2K STIMULUS CHECKS \"Let me first go on record and\u00a0say, it\u2019s absurd,\u00a0the\u00a0$2,000 checks,\" Moore said. \"I think it\u2019s important to\u00a0realize, we have spent now, already\u00a0$2.5 trillion. That\u2019s more money than we\u00a0collect and income taxes for an entire year. Plus, this\u00a0would add another $500 billion to the debt,\" he explained. \"Plus, President-elect Biden is now saying he wants\u00a0another one or $2 trillion dollars stimulus on top of that. Moore said the U.S. government has been \"spending money like it\u2019s M&M's\" over the course of the coronavirus pandemic. \"It\u2019s not a way to stimulate\u00a0the economy,\" he argued,\u00a0warning,\u00a0\"We are passing these costs onto\u00a0our children and grandchildren.\" McConnell, R-Ky., in floor remarks lambasted the House-passed bill for $2,000 stimulus checks as \"socialism for rich people\" earlier Thursday.\u00a0His comments came days after he introduced his own bill for $2,000 stimulus checks, tying them to\u00a0other Trump priorities:\u00a0repealing controversial Section 230 liability protections for online platforms and investigating election security. He made no promises that the bill would be considered, only vague comments that the Senate would \"begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus.\" Moore said McConnell's latest demands are \"reasonable,\" arguing that Americans would benefit more from a safe reopening of the country than from a boosted stimulus check.\u00a0 HERE'S WHEN YOUR SECOND STIMULUS CHECK WILL ARRIVE \"The best way to help the\u00a0economy, I would say to all the\u00a0senators,\u00a0is to get the jobs\u00a0back, in states like California, New York\u00a0that\u2019s destroying restaurants, small\u00a0businesses, retailers.\u00a0There is no reason so many of\u00a0these places are shut down like this,\" Moore said. \"And by the way,\" he added, \"the ultimate stimulus to the economy is the\u00a0vaccine.\" Fox News' Tyler Olsen contributed to this report.

And he knows it.\" He then blasted Durbin for \"refus[ing]\" to take his question during their heated exchange on the Senate floor, saying the Democratic Whip has made Twitter his \"forum\" of choice. \"Dick, on the Senate floor, you refused to take my question. You\u2019ve chosen Twitter as your forum,\" added Cruz. \"Ok, respond with FACTS \u2014 not just partisan invective.\" The Texas senator continued on his thread with a pop quiz of nine questions pertaining to illegal immigrants receiving Covid-19\u00a0stimulus checks, pointing out that \"60%\u00a0of illegal aliens are visa overstays\" as well as why \"every Dem vote[d] against\" his amendment \"prohibiting sending $1400 checks to illegal immigrants.\" \"True or false: Migrants who come to US legally on a work visa are allowed to have a SSN, yet when they overstay their visa they become illegal aliens,\" Cruz asked. Cruz\u2019s final question to Durbin was whether or not \"the Lefty journos echoing your false charge\" will \"also apologize?\" When asked for comment on the tweets, Cruz\u2019s office referred Fox News back to the tweet thread. Durbin\u2019s office did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.

Rashida Tlaib, D.-Mich., voiced a call for $2,000 monthly payments to everyone for the duration of the coronavirus pandemic, hosting an event Thursday to argue why it should be included in the next stimulus bill. Tlaib unveiled the \u201cMint the Coin\u201d proposal in April with Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash. Tlaib argued in a \u201cMoney to the People\u201d webcast Thursday that not only were \u201cone-time\u201d $1,200 stimulus payments not enough, they were leaving out portions of the population. DEM. 'SQUAD' MEMBERS JOIN GROWING CHORUS OF CALLS TO '#CANCELRENT' DURING CORONAVIRUS CRISIS \u201cNo matter how many moratoriums, those bills are still going to be due later on,\u201d Tlaib said. \u201cPeople call me saying, \u2018I qualified for the stimulus but I didn\u2019t have direct deposit so I\u2019m waiting still,\u201d the congresswoman explained. She added that the payments weren\u2019t making their\u00a0way to vulnerable populations, such as victims of domestic abuse or the homeless. Tlaib explained her plan would supply every American with a debit card that would receive recurring payments of $2,000 per month for the duration of the pandemic, \u201cuntil this is over, none of this one-time stuff.\u201d SANDERS CALLS FOR $2G MONTHLY PAYMENTS, RENT FREEZE IN NEXT STIMULUS PACKAGE In addition, everyone would receive $1,000 per month added to their debit card for at least one year following the pandemic. Tlaib\u2019s $1,000 post-pandemic add-on was a step further than Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, who called for the $2,000 relief payments during the pandemic at the beginning of April. The plan would be paid for by the printing of two $1 trillion coins. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In April, Tlaib co-sponsored a bill with fellow \u201csquad\u201d members Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., to cancel all rent and mortgage payments throughout the pandemic. The bill would establish full rent forgiveness and a relief fund for landlords and mortgage owners.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. By a vote of 96-0, the Senate passed\u00a0a massive $2 trillion\u00a0coronavirus stimulus compromise package\u00a0just before midnight Wednesday, ending days of deadlock and sending the bill to the\u00a0House of Representatives --\u00a0which House Speaker\u00a0Nancy Pelosi said will soon take up the historic measure to bring relief to individuals, small businesses, and larger corporations \"with strong bipartisan support.\" The 880-page\u00a0legislation is the largest economic relief bill in U.S. history. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., appeared somber and exhausted as he announced the vote.\u00a0He released senators from Washington until April 20, though he promised to recall them if needed. \"96-0 in the United States Senate,\" President Trump wrote on Twitter.\u00a0\"Congratulations AMERICA!\" The unanimous vote came despite misgivings on both sides about whether it goes too far or not far enough. The vote capped days of difficult negotiations as Washington confronted a national challenge unlike any it has ever faced. Unemployment numbers were set to be revealed Thursday morning, and experts warned they could reach alarming new highs. The package\u00a0would provide one-time direct payments to Americans of $1,200 per adult making up to $75,000 a year, and $2,400 to married couples\u00a0making up to $150,000, with $500 payments per child.\u00a0After a $75,000 threshold\u00a0for individuals, the benefit would be reduced by $5 for each $100 the taxpayer makes. A similar $150,000 threshold applies to couples, and a $112,500 threshold for heads of households. READ THE FINAL BILL;\u00a0READ A SUMMARY OF THE BILL\u00a0;\u00a0READ THE SASSE AMENDMENT The legislation passed by the Senate will use 2019 tax returns, if available, or 2018 tax returns to assess income for determining how much direct financial aid individuals receive. Those who did not file tax returns can use a Form SSA-1099, Social Security Benefit Statement\u00a0or Form RRB-1099, a\u00a0Social Security Equivalent Benefit Statement, per Page 149 of the bill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. gives a thumbs up as he leaves the Senate chamber on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, March 25, 2020, where a deal has been reached on a coronavirus bill. The 2 trillion dollar stimulus bill is expected to be voted on in the Senate Wednesday. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  Further, the bill allocates $250 billion to extend unemployment insurance to more workers, and lengthen the duration to 39 weeks, up from the normal 26 weeks.\u00a0$600 extra a week would be provided for four months. (Just before voting on the final package began late Wednesday, the Senate was debating an\u00a0amendment from Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., to bar people from getting more from new unemployment benefits than they would have received on the job; the amendment needed\u00a060 votes and failed 48-48.) The final package\u00a0would additionally provide $349 billion in loans to small businesses -- and money spent on rent, payroll and utilities becomes grants that don't need to be paid back. Many hotels would qualify as small businesses under the plan. Passenger airlines would receive $25 billion for workers' \"salaries and benefits,\" plus up to $25 billion more in loan guarantees and loans. Contract workers would also receive $3 billion in assistance. Airlines would have to agree not to furlough workers until at least the end of September in return. WHO QUALIFIES FOR A CHECK? About $17 billion will go to other distressed companies like Boeing, which is seen as essential to national security. And, approximately $200 billion would be provided in tax assistance to small businesses, including through payroll tax deferrals. At the same time, the\u00a0bill omits many -- though\u00a0not all --\u00a0items from\u00a0Pelosi's version of the legislation that Republicans had called wasteful or irrelevant, including climate-change-related emissions restrictions for airlines and various diversity-related provisions. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif. speaks outside her office on Capitol Hill, Monday, March 23, 2020. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, Pool)  Gone from the stimulus bill are mentions of mandatory early voting, ballot harvesting, requirements that federal agencies review their usage of \"minority banks,\" and attempts to curb airlines' carbon emissions -- a Pelosi demand\u00a0that even Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and an author of the Green New Deal, called \"ridiculous.\" \"What's not in the Senate's bipartisan coronavirus bill:\u00a0Pelosi's outrageous wish list,\" wrote GOP national spokesperson Elizabeth Harrington. \"0 mentions of 'diversity.' 0 mentions of 'emissions.' 0 mentions of 'early voting.'\u00a00 mentions of 'climate change.'\u00a0Good!\" But, the package still contained some wins for Pelosi. Page 524 of the bill text indicates that many\u00a0businesses that take a government loan would be obligated to remain neutral in any \"union organizing effort\" during the loan -- a major giveaway to unions. Affected businesses would have between 500 and 10,000 employees. And, Page 781 of the bill provides $25 million to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives to cover \"salary and expenses.\" Also in the final bill text, $25 million would still be allocated for the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\u00a0Trump, speaking at the White House coronavirus briefing earlier Wednesday, said that he understood the provision was necessary because Democrats demanded some concessions in order to get the stimulus bill passed, even though it galled some conservatives. Pelosi was the first to demand\u00a0the Kennedy Center money in her own bill, which Republicans said was full of unseemly payouts for well-connected special interests at a time of national crisis. The Kennedy Center put out a\u00a0statement Wednesday evening\u00a0saying it was \"extraordinarily grateful that Congress has recognized our institution's unique status and has included funding in its legislation to ensure that we can reopen our doors and stages as soon as we are able.\" \"For an opera house, you sure are tone-deaf,\" responded blogger Jim Treacher, after telling the Kennedy Center where to shove its statement. John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts shot at dusk across the Potomac in Georgetown  Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said the House would vote\u00a0on the matter on Friday. Republican leaders said they'd whip votes to support the bill. \"Over the past few days, the Senate has stepped into the breach,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in his own remarks. \"We packed weeks or perhaps months of the legislative process into five days. Representatives from both sides of the aisle and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have forged a bipartisan agreement in highly partisan times, with very little time to spare.\" He added: \"It\u2019s been a long, hard road, with a remarkable number of twists and turns, but for the sake of millions of Americans, it will be worth it. It will be worth it to get help to millions of small businesses and save tens of millions of jobs.\" However, earlier in the day, a\u00a0senior GOP source\u00a0told\u00a0Fox News contributor and Townhall.com editor Guy Benson that the compromise bill was a face-saving exercise by Schumer, and that he was trying to \"take credit\" for a GOP bill that he filibustered\u00a0for \"small ball\" alterations. Democrats, the source said, couldn't drag the situation out much longer;\u00a0economic conditions have worsened dramatically, and President Trump's\u00a0approval rating\u00a0has risen. Stocks rally after Senate reaches deal on stimulus; White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow weighs in. And, a senior Republican aide separately told Fox News: \"I half expected that the next thing I read would be the Minority Leader taking credit for inventing fire. The reality is that almost every significant 'win' he's taking credit for, is actually a Senate Republican idea.\" Republicans had \"never objected\" to more hospital funding, or that oversight of the stimulus stabilization fund \"be structured almost exactly like TARP oversight,\" the aide went on. And Republicans were the first to\u00a0push for three months of unemployment insurance and \"did not oppose adding a fourth.\" The stimulus movement came as stocks posted their first back-to-back gains in weeks, but much of Wednesday's early rally faded as the hitch developed in the Senate. The market is down nearly 27 percent\u00a0since setting a record high a month ago. Amid the debate, presidential hopeful Sen.\u00a0Bernie Sanders said\u00a0he might try to torpedo the Senate's stimulus package as\u00a0Republican senators raised objections about what they called a \"massive drafting error\" related to unemployment benefits. \u201cIn my view, it would be an outrage to prevent working-class Americans to receive the emergency unemployment assistance included in this legislation,\" Sanders said in a statement, also posted on social media. Sanders took to the Senate floor late Wednesday at approximately 9:30 p.m. ET to say he was concerned that the administration would be able to \"expend $500 billion in virtually any way they want\" under the legislation. In fact, the administration would not have such unilateral control. DO YOU QUALIFY FOR A STIMULUS CHECK? \"They're very upset that somebody who is making 10, 12 bucks an hour might end up with a paycheck for four months more than they received last week,\" Sanders went on.\u00a0\"Oh, my god, the universe is collapsing!\" The\u00a0concern from Sens. Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott, R-S.C., Sasse,\u00a0and Rick Scott, R-Fla., was\u00a0that the the bill\u00a0could pay workers more in unemployment benefits than they'd make in salary, by sticking a $600 per week payment on top of ordinary benefits that are calculated as a percentage of income. Democrats and economists have countered that the point of the new unemployment benefit is, in fact, to make peoples' salaries whole, and that companies could simply\u00a0raise wages to compete and attract workers. \"The weird thing about this hypothetical 'generous unemployment pay will discourage people from entering critical industries'\u00a0is... they could just raise wages?\" Alex Godofsky wrote on Twitter. \"Amazon has already raised wages. Like, it's okay if wages - and prices - go up for a while. It's fine.\" Others have noted that the unemployment benefits\u00a0boost would expire in the summer. In an article entitled \"Republican Senators\u2019 Objection to Expanded Unemployment Benefits Makes Little Sense,\" Josh Barro began by noting that \"these are unemployment benefits, and you generally have to have been laid off to claim them.\" \"We will continue to have virus-mitigation measures that create mass unemployment for a significant period, and even after those measures can be relaxed through much of the country, it will take some time for employers to re-ingest all the previously laid-off workers,\" Barro wrote.\u00a0\"In fact, it\u2019s likely that the shutdowns will persist long enough that the enhanced benefits will need to be extended. If we\u2019re in a situation by July where all the shutdowns are over and employers are eagerly hiring and our biggest concern is too many people don\u2019t want to go back to work, I will be overjoyed and very surprised.\" Later Wednesday, the Republicans agreed to drop their objections to fast-tracking the stimulus vote, as long as there was first a vote on the Sasse amendment to cap unemployment benefits to 100 percent of salary. Also in the evening, Pelosi said unanimous consent was a nonstarter in the House, and implied that quick passage in the lower chamber may be unrealistic. Pelosi has called for members to have at least 24 hours to review the bill text once it's available. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, left, accompanied by White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland and acting White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, speaks with reporters as he walks to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky. on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, March 24, 2020. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)  \u201cThat\u2019s not gonna work,\" she told reporters shortly after\u00a07:30 p.m. ET, referring to unanimous consent. \"Republicans have told us that\u2019s not possible from their said. ... What I\u2019d like to see -- because this a $2 trillion bill -- I\u2019d like to see a good debate on the floor.\" Meanwhile, the White House projected confidence. Insistently optimistic, President Trump said of the greatest public-health emergency in anyone's lifetime, \"I don\u2019t think it's going to end up being such a rough patch\" and anticipated the economy soaring \u201clike a rocket ship\u201d when it's over. Yet he implored Congress late in the day to move on critical aid without further delay. The package is intended as relief for an economy spiraling into recession or worse and a nation facing a grim toll from an infection that's killed nearly 20,000 people worldwide. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, asked how long the aid would keep the economy afloat, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve anticipated three months. Hopefully, we won\u2019t need this for three months.\" Underscoring the effort's sheer magnitude, the bill finances a response with a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion annual federal budget.

Just 12% of the over $100 billion earmarked for elementary and secondary schools has been spent so far, according to federal statistics. And according to Treasury Department figures, as of the end of March 2022 only about $70 billion of the $350 billion allocated for state and local governments had been spent. Just over $100 billion of that money was contractually committed to be spent.\u00a0 A Treasury spokesperson told Fox News Digital that 67% of the money available to state and local governments through March was budgeted \u2014 and likely more, due to smaller jurisdictions not reporting.

Sperling also said the passage of the ARPA funding lit a fire under school districts and motivated them to spend other COVID-related federal money they'd not yet allocated \"ten times\" faster. Bydlak said such an argument \"rings a little bit hollow\" from \"the same people who have largely fought\" efforts to repurpose the ARPA funds elsewhere. Riedl was more blunt.\u00a0 \"If they were concerned that schools were not spending their own money fast enough they could have required that schools spent their money fast rather than giving them another $130 billion,\" he said. \"That's an insane misuse of tax dollars.\" Tyler Olson is a Capitol Hill Producer for Fox News in Washington, D.C.\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92025 FOX News Network, LLC.

Convicted\u00a0Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev recently revised his $250,000 lawsuit against the federal government, appealing to incoming U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland to grant him additional privileges while incarcerated at a maximum-security prison in Colorado.  In an amended, handwritten complaint, the 26-year-old said he was suffering \"psychological injury, emotional distress, and destruction of my familial relationships,\" the Boston Herald reported.  WHITE HOUSE TOUTS COVID RELIEF BILL AS 'TRANSFORMATIONAL, FRANKLY PROGRESSIVE' LEGISLATION BEFORE HOUSE VOTE\u00a0 He appealed to Garland to intervene, claiming the Federal Correctional Complex Florence is preventing him from sending photos to his family and hobby crafts to his lawyers, WHDH also reported.  Tsarnaev reportedly lamented that he is forbidden to communicate with his younger nieces and nephews, has his phone calls strictly monitored and his mail \"censored.\" He wants to be moved to a Level 2 security level and requested that the $2,300 currently on hold in his prison canteen account be released to him, according to reports.

        "text": "Games\nThird Way co-founder Matt Bennett and former State Department senior adviser Matt Mowers react on \u2018America\u2019s Newsroom.\u2019 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer of \"trying to pull a fast one,\" warning in a floor speech Wednesday that there was \"no realistic path\" to quickly approve larger stimulus checks for Americans contending with the coronavirus pandemic. McConnell accused Pelosi and Schumer of attempting to \"warp\" President Trump\u2019s call for $2,000 direct payments to Americans. The majority leader said the Senate would not separate a vote on $2,000 stimulus checks from a bill\u00a0backed by GOP leaders that includes the establishment of a commission to investigate election fraud and a repeal of Section 230, the measure which protects social media platforms from liability over third-party posts. WARNOCK SAYS GEORGIANS 'CAN'T TRUST' LOEFFLER AFTER SHE BACKS CALLS FOR $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS \"As they\u2019ve tried to do countless times in the past four years, Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer are trying to pull a fast one on the president and the American people,\" McConnell said. \"First of all, they\u2019re hoping that everyone just forgets about election integrity and Big Tech. They\u2019re desperate to ignore those two parts of President Trump\u2019s request.\" President Trump and lawmakers from both sides of the political aisle have called on Congress to approve $2,000 direct payments, up from the $600 checks currently detailed in a $900 billion coronavirus stimulus package approved last weekend. Earlier this week, McConnell said the Senate would \"begin a process\" to consider larger stimulus checks after the body blocked a measure from House Democrats that called for an immediate vote. McConnell said Democratic leaders sought to push through a package that would vastly increase the national debt and provide money to families that are not in dire need of aid.\u00a0 \"Look, it's no secret that Republicans have a diversity of views about the wisdom of borrowing hundreds of billions more to send out more non-targeted money, including to many households that have suffered no loss of income during the crisis,\" McConnell said. \"COVID-19 has not affected all households equally.\" Pelosi, Schumer and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-VT, have led calls among Democrats for increased cash payments to Americans. Schumer said he would call for a Senate vote on the House bill seeking larger payments later Wednesday night. \"At the very least, the Senate deserves the opportunity for an up-or-down vote on increasing the individual payments to the American people,\" the New York senator said. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP McConnell\u2019s remarks raised further doubt about the potential approval of larger payments. Democrats have opposed calls for a repeal of Section 230 and establishment of an election integrity commission. The Treasury Department and the IRS began sending out a second wave of direct payments this week. Officials said the payments will be \"topped up as quickly as possible\" if Congress approves the release of larger checks.

        "text": "Games\nHouse Minority Leader McCarthy, R-Calif., provides an update on coronavirus relief negotiations in Congress on 'Fox &amp; Friends.' House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy lambasted Speaker Nancy Pelosi over the monthslong coronavirus\u00a0relief deadlock, accusing the Democratic leader of intentionally blocking a stimulus deal in order to hurt Republicans in the 2020\u00a0election. \"The speaker of this House has denied the ability to [get] help\u00a0to the American public, simply because she wanted to determine something would happen in the election, to harm President Trump and him getting re-elected,\" McCarthy told reporters during a Thursday press conference. \"But what has happened is American people are hurting. That has got to stop.\" McCarthy slammed Democrats for focusing on issues beyond a stimulus deal and a government funding bill to avoid a shutdown on Dec. 11. 12 MILLION AMERICANS FACE LOSS OF UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS The main bill on the House floor this week is a measure to end a federal ban on\u00a0marijuana and require courts to expunge prior marijuana convictions. Lawmakers will also take up the Big Cat Public Safety Act, which would ban the ownership of big cats like lions and tigers -- a bill spurred by the popular Netflix docuseries \"Tiger King.\"\u00a0 \"Democrats have focused on cats and cannabis, but not on COVID,\" McCarthy said. \"You'd think after a\u00a0humiliating defeat in the ballot box this year ... that Democrats would get the picture that Americans are demanding some action on these issues.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The California Republican's comments came as Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who for months have maintained that at least $2.2 trillion in spending is needed for emergency relief efforts, indicated they were open to a more narrow bill.\u00a0In a joint statement, the Democratic leaders embraced a bipartisan $908 billion relief deal as the starting point for negotiations -- a major concession. BIDEN CALLS FOR ERASING SOME STUDENT LOAN DEBT, FACES PROGRESSIVE PRESSURE TO GO FURTHER \"In the spirit of compromise, we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by Senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,\" they\u00a0wrote. \"Of course, we and others will offer improvements, but the need to act is immediate and we believe that with good-faith negotiations we could come to an agreement.\" The $908 billion framework, unveiled Tuesday by a bipartisan group of senators,\u00a0allocates about\u00a0$300 billion in funding for small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program, $240 billion in aid for state and local governments, $180 billion to extend boosted unemployment benefits at $300 per week through March\u00a0and a temporary moratorium on COVID liability lawsuits to allow states enough time to design their own laws. It would also funnel\u00a0$16 billion into vaccine distribution, testing and contact tracing, put\u00a0$82 billion into education, and give\u00a0$45 billion for\u00a0transportation.\u00a0The deal notably does not include a second stimulus check. PELOSI, SCHUMER URGE MCCONNELL TO RESTART CORONAVIRUS RELIEF TALKS Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell quickly rejected the plan on Tuesday and stood by his\u00a0\"highly targeted\" $500 billion proposal.\u00a0He also said that a spending bill needed to avoid a government shutdown on Dec. 11 and pandemic relief provisions will \"all likely come in one package.\u201d Senate Democrats have twice blocked McConnell's bill, which focused on providing funding for small businesses, aid for schools and liability protections for businesses, arguing that it did not go far enough in helping workers and businesses still reeling from the crisis. But McConnell\u00a0said Thursday that he has seen \"hopeful signs\" for reaching a deal before the end of the year. \u201cCompromise is within reach. We know where we agree. We can do this,\u201d he\u00a0said on the Senate floor. Renewed\u00a0relief talks come at an increasingly perilous time for the nation as it teeters on the brink of another economic downturn.\u00a0COVID-19 cases are surging\u00a0\u2014 on Wednesday, the U.S. reported its highest number of coronavirus deaths in a single day with 3,157 new fatalities\u00a0\u2014 state\u00a0and local governments are implementing more restriction measures and\u00a0new unemployment insurance claims are rising. At the same time, safety nets set up in the early days of the pandemic with the passage of the March CARES Act have already lapsed or are set to do so at the end of December. About 12 million laid-off workers will be left with no income on Dec. 26 after two key federal jobless aid programs expire, according to one\u00a0estimate\u00a0from the Century Foundation, a nonprofit think tank.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi acknowledged Thursday the long odds of the Democrats' $3 trillion coronavirus relief legislation of becoming law and suggested the massive bill could be a starting point of negotiations with the White House and Senate. \"We're putting our offer on the table, we're open to negotiation,\" Pelosi said Thursday on the eve of the planned vote on the HEROES Act. HOUSE DEMS UNVEIL CORONAVIRUS BILL ESTIMATED TO COST $3T, IN LARGEST STIMULUS PACKAGE YET Her comments came just as the White House issued an official veto threat on the legislation, accusing Democrats of wanting to pass \"long-standing partisan and ideological wish lists\" rather than addressing the nation's public health and economic challenges. The White House\u00a0chided Democrats for making certain undocumented immigrants eligible for the second round of\u00a0$1,200 direct payments, for including a $25 billion \"bailout\" for the U.S. Postal Service and for\u00a0funding vote-by-mail and same-day registration priorities. DEMOCRATS' $3T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL EXTENDS STIMULUS CHECKS TO CERTAIN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS But at the Capitol, Pelosi framed the legislation -- the biggest relief package in history -- as a necessary expense to deal with the unprecedented economic and health crisis that has left nearly 85,000 Americans dead and 36 million jobless. \"This is really quite an exciting time for us because we have a monumental need for our\u00a0country at this sad time,\" Pelosi said. During a press conference,\u00a0she brought up the overwhelming bipartisan support that the previous four coronavirus bills have garnered and argued that Republicans have already voted in favor of many of the issues in the bill,\u00a0such as coronavirus testing, $1,200 direct payments to most Americans, expanded unemployment help and state and local government funds. \"Eighty\u00a0percent of the bill we have already passed in one way, shape or form,\" Pelosi said. While House Democrats drafted the bill solo without the Senate Republicans or the White House, Pelosi said it's not uncommon for one branch to take the lead to get the talks moving. STIMULUS CHECKS, STATE AID AND MORE: WHAT\u2019S IN HOUSE DEMOCRATS' NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL \"This is not new that one side of the aisle might ... put something on the table -- as they did in the two previous bills -- and now we're putting ours [forward]\u00a0and invite negotiation,\" Pelosi said. Republicans and Senate leadership have been cool to a fifth round of coronavirus relief legislation arguing it's time to pause after nearly $3 trillion has already borrowed for pay for the aid\u00a0to small businesses, laid-off workers and Americans stuck at home. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blasted the House proposal earlier Thursday as \"a\u00a0totally unserious effort.\" During a scathing floor speech, McConnell ticked off examples of \"left-wing oddities\" inside the coronavirus bill. \"House Democrats had a blank slate to write anything they wanted to define the modern Democratic Party,\" McConnell said. \"... And they chose: Tax hikes on small business, giveaways to blue-state millionaires, government checks for illegal immigrants, and sending diversity detectives to inspect the pot industry.\" DEMOCRATS' $3T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL IS TOO SMALL FOR SOME PROGRESSIVES With Republicans not even agreeing more help is needed,\u00a0Pelosi Thursday sought to ramp up the public support for the new legislation and unveiled new links on her website to determine how much each state would benefit. Pelosi was just about to end her press conference at the Capitol when she pulled down her green-printed\u00a0mask to make another pitch for Americans to see how much money could come into their communities under the Democrats' plan. \"Don't forget to go to speaker.gov,\" Pelosi said, \"to see where you live, how much money goes there.\" A vote on the bill is slated for Friday in the House, despite objections from progressive leaders who want more time to amend the legislation.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have not yet forged a compromise on a coronavirus stimulus bill but negotiations continue. \"We're at the table discussing how we go forward with a possible COVID bill,\" Pelosi said at a news conference Thursday. \"We're hopeful that we can reach agreement because the needs of\u00a0the American people are so great,\" the top House Democrat added. \"But there has to be a recognition that it takes money to do that.\" MCCONNELL ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF DEAL: 'WE ARE VERY, VERY FAR APART' Pelosi signaled the House would move forward with a vote as soon as Thursday on the Democrats' latest offer: a $2.2 trillion relief bill. If\u00a0passed, it would be the second bill the House\u00a0passed since May to address the pandemic while the Senate has failed to advance anything. The House was prepared to pass the legislation Wednesday, but the vote was delayed in case Pelosi and Mnuchin could forge a new bipartisan compromise. \"We\u00a0are not finished,\" Pelosi said of the state of talks. \"I'm hopeful. But we do come at it from two different places.\" MNUCHIN, PELOSI MAKE LAST-DITCH PUSH FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF DEAL AHEAD OF NOVEMBER ELECTION Mnuchin had been negotiating on behalf of the White House, while Senate Republicans have rejected any new massive spending bill over concerns of the rising deficit.\u00a0Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday called the Democrats' latest offer of $2.2 trillion \"outlandish\" and suggested his GOP majority wants to stay around $500 billion. SECOND ROUND OF STIMULUS CHECKS WOULD BE INCLUDED IN CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL: MNUCHIN The House originally passed a $3.4 trillion bill in May known as the HEROES Act\u00a0-- the largest spending bill on record in U.S. history. But the Senate rebuked the legislation as an overpriced liberal\u00a0wish list. McConnell offered up two counter-proposals\u00a0in the months since at $1 trillion and about $300 billion, respectively, but neither could pass the Senate as Democrats said the effort didn't meet the gravity of the pandemic. The $2.2 trillion House bill up for a vote, known as HEROES 2.0,\u00a0would give Americans an economic lifeline as previous coronavirus relief programs have dried up. HOUSE DEMOCRATS' NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL ELIMINATES $600M FOR POLICING: 'IT'S SHAMEFUL' The legislation would provide additional direct payments of\u00a0$1,200 per taxpayer (included undocumented immigrants who pay taxes) and $500 per dependent, restore unemployment benefits of $600 weekly federal assistance through January and revive the Paycheck Protection Program to serve the smallest businesses and struggling nonprofits.

The embattled Louisiana pastor who made headlines for flouting\u00a0social distancing measures\u00a0and was arrested Tuesday after being accused of\u00a0nearly running over a protester with a bus\u00a0is asking congregants and other Americans to donate their stimulus checks to his church.  Pastor Tony Spell of the Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge said he, his wife and children have all donated the stimulus money they received from the federal government\u00a0to the church fund designated to help evangelists, missionaries, and music ministers, WAFB-TV in Baton Rouge reported.  Using #PastorSpellStimulusChallenge, he is asking members of his congregation and other Americans to do the same, arguing these men and women of faith have not been able to receive contributions from normal church collections in over a month, as houses of worship are forced to remain closed under a statewide stay-at-home order meant to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Appearing on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day Weekend\u201d on Sunday, Spell defended his decision to ask congregants for their federal stimulus checks, arguing the money would help churches from becoming directly dependent on government funding and control. \u201cWe are giving to those who do not have,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cWe are challenging you, if you can, give your stimulus package to evangelists and missionaries who do not get the package. They don\u2019t file taxes the way you and I do.\u201d Spell said he decided not to apply for the Payroll Protection Program passed by Congress last month, despite nonprofits and faith-based ministries being eligible for aid to keep employees, including evangelists and foreign missionaries, on the payroll.  \u201cWe do not want SBA loans,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the government to give us a dime. We are happy to provide for ourselves. Never will our federal or state government put one penny into our church, because the second they do, they control us.\u201d CALIFORNIA CHURCHES SUE NEWSOM OVER CORONAVIRUS STAY-AT-HOME ORDER Meanwhile, the Central Police Department in Louisiana said Tuesday that Spell turned himself in after a\u00a0warrant was issued for his arrest\u00a0a day earlier. He was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and improper backing of a vehicle related to an incident over the weekend.  He was released Tuesday afternoon. Tony Spell, who was taken to jail Tuesday morning, April 21, 2020, after being arrested by police in Central, Louisiana, on charges including aggravated assault. Officials in Louisiana arrested the pastor, who allegedly drove a bus at a man protesting the pastor's continued defiance of orders to stay at home to limit the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. (East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office via AP)  Spell was reportedly filmed backing a church bus toward a protester outside the church before stopping a few feet away from him, according to local media reports.  \u201cThat man has been in front of my church driveway for three weeks now,\u201d Spell told WAFB-TV on Monday. \u201cHe shoots people obscene finger gestures and shouts vulgarities. LOUISIANA PASTOR WHO FLOUTED CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS ARRESTED FOR BACKING UP BUS TOWARD PROTESTER \u201cI was pulling in from my bus route, picking up black children who haven\u2019t eaten because of this sinister policy that has closed schools,\u201d he added. \u201cI was going to approach this gentleman and ask him to leave.\u201d The protester, Trey Bennett, told the news station that he's been demonstrating outside of the church since Easter Sunday. One of his signs reads: \u201cCAUTION: Coronavirus incubator. Do not enter. You may die.\u201d A second arrest warrant was issued for the driver of a truck that appeared swerve off the road in a separate attempt to hit Bennett, police said. \u201cAnd he [man in white truck] was going very fast. He just pulled over at me and turned into the church. That was much faster than what Tony Spell was doing when he drove the bus at me,\u201d Bennett said. While most churches have transitioned to virtual religious services amid the coronavirus pandemic, Spell continued to hold in-person services with hundreds of followers despite a stay-at-home order issued by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. One Sunday service drew an estimated 500 parishioners. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Spell was also arrested last month and charged with six misdemeanor counts for violating the order. Speaking to Fox News after that arrest, the pastor said he was exercising his First Amendment rights and a mandate from Jesus Christ.

        "text": "Games\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes he can he convince Republicans to go along if he writes the bill capping the price tag at $1 trillion; congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u00a0is signaling a new coronavirus bill may come soon, weeks after Democrats started pummeling the Kentucky Republican for not teeing up another\u00a0major COVID-19 package like the House did back in May. \u201cThis is not over. We are seeing a resurgence in a lot of states,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI think the country needs one last boost.\u201d But, the legislative \u201cboost\u201d is iffy \u2013 even according to McConnell. \u201cIf there is another one, it will come together in July,\u201d McConnell said in mid-June, speaking in Ashland, Ky. McConnell clearly knows it will be hard to get Democrats and Republicans to align on\u00a0another bill. A senior Senate GOP leadership source reiterated nothing would be a foregone conclusion.  Yes, the Democrats have had a long list of demands. They certainly hope an additional coronavirus package would resemble the $3 trillion measure House Democrats advanced in May \u2013 the most expensive bill in congressional history. And certainly, Senate Republicans won\u2019t consider that plan. But, there\u2019s sharp disagreement among members of the GOP on the next package.  \u201cWe\u2019re studying the economic data very, very carefully,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. \u201cIf there is another bill, it will be targeted. Hopefully we\u2019ll learn from our first three bills in terms of what works and what doesn\u2019t. The subtext or the undercurrent here, at least on my side of the aisle, is the fact that we owe $3 trillion and climbing. This is real debt, and that doesn\u2019t even include the $3 trillion we added to the federal reserve balance sheet [for coronavirus].\u201d Such profligate spending is partly why McConnell halted coronavirus spending back in the spring.  \u201cI think we ought to take a pause here. Do a good job of evaluating what we've already done,\u201d McConnell said on May 5. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., seized on McConnell\u2019s lull. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany responds to reports on Russian bounties, comments made by Speaker Pelosi. \u201cThe virus doesn\u2019t pause. Unemployment doesn\u2019t pause. Hunger doesn\u2019t pause,\u201d Pelosi said. McConnell spoke with President Trump last week about the possibilities of another bill. Fox News is told the majority leader believed he could\u00a0convince Republicans to go along if he himself\u00a0wrote the legislation. That\u2019s why McConnell\u2019s repeatedly dismissed the expensive House plan. McConnell reiterated that such a measure would be written \u201cin my office.\u201d Fox News is told Republicans were aiming for a bill costing no more than $1 trillion. Trump and McConnell aren\u2019t ruling out another round of targeted, direct stimulus checks \u2013 especially for those making less than $40,000. But, there\u2019s GOP division there, too. COMPANY TIED TO PELOSI RECEIVED PPP FUNDS, DOCUMENTS SHOW \u201cI\u2019ve always said that the direct stimulus checks are going to depend on how the economy\u2019s doing,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cassidy,\u00a0R-La. \u201cObviously we just had great unemployment numbers, meaning it looks like there might be a sharp uptick back, right? And so if it turns out the economy is recovering, that\u2019s a good thing and direct stimulus checks may not be necessary. So, I think we\u2019re still kind of collating and understanding the data as it comes in.\u201d The Trump administration has continued to advocate for one idea unpopular with both Republicans and Democrats: a cut in the payroll taxes employers pay on behalf of their workers. The federal government has levied such taxes on the wages of employees. Payroll taxes have financed Social Security and Medicare, which have accounted for nearly a quarter of all government revenue. Pruning the payroll tax cut could further explode the national debt, contributing hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars of red ink \u2013 on top of the staggering spending OK'd by Congress this year alone.  No wonder conservatives like John Kennedy are worried about spending.  Still, the White House has remained unbowed in its push for a payroll tax cut. \u201cThe payroll tax is something of great interest to the president because it would help low- and middle-income Americans most,\u201d White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. \u201cI think the payroll tax cut could be an important part of, among other things, bringing Americans back to work and fueling job growth in the country,\u201d Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia told Mike Emanuel on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Still, additional unemployment benefits could emerge as the biggest flashpoint. Congress approved an extra $600 in unemployment aid each week for those out of work in the spring, but the Trump administration and many Republicans have seemed cool to the idea now.  \u201cI think as we reopen the economy, I don\u2019t know that we need a benefit like that,\u201d Scalia said. \u201cDuring the so-called \u2018Great Recession,\u2019 10, 12 years ago when we had a downturn, the added federal unemployment benefit was $25 a week. And, what we did in the CARES Act was $600 a week. So, I think this is something we\u2019ll get a look at, but I don\u2019t think we need that $600 benefit going forward.\u201d Democrats have been insistent on re-upping the unemployment help, set to expire at the end of the month.  \u201cUnemployment is still a problem for people basically [whose]\u00a0jobs are lost or basically shut down and can\u2019t reopen because of the [pandemic]. We\u2019ve got to make sure we\u2019re taking care of the people that\u2019s been mostly affected and continue to be affected,\u201d said Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. In addition, McConnell has been determined that a new bill include liability protections for businesses and schools, curbing people from suing because they contracted coronavirus while working or in class. McConnell also wanted to craft a provision to help schools reopen safely this fall. And, multiple\u00a0Senate Republicans have been drafting plans to pay people bonuses for returning to work \u2013 as well as tipping businesses a premium for rehiring workers. Such a program may sound good \u2013 but it would be\u00a0expensive.  McConnell said he\u2019s \u201cpretty sure\u201d they\u2019ll assemble some legislation in the coming weeks. But, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll take any significant\u00a0action until both the House and Senate return to session in earnest later this month. The only action on Capitol Hill between now and July 20\u00a0are various House hearings and markups \u2013 with just a skeleton crew of lawmakers attending in person. Still, another coronavirus bill is the \u201cif.\u201d There\u2019s a chasm between the sides when it comes to something which can get to the president\u2019s desk. McConnell long ago said Congress can\u2019t just continue to produce big bills. That\u2019s why he wanted the economy to reopen as much as it could. And, in order to keep as much of the economy churning as possible, McConnell\u2019s adopted a new mantra: Wear a mask. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \u201cWe can\u2019t shut the economy down again,\u201d McConnell warned. \u201cA lot of people thought when we started opening up the economy again, let the good times roll.\u201d So, the next coronavirus bill could be the big \u201cif.\u201d But, the economic health of the country is hinging on the recent surge of cases. And that\u2019s an even bigger \u201cif.\u201d  Fox News\u2019\u00a0Mike Emanuel contributed to this report.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., criticized President Biden's decision to tighten income limits on coronavirus relief, arguing that he was sending less money to people than his predecessor did. \"I see it as a really disappointing development,\" she told CNN anchor Brianna Keilar. \"We obviously are now ultimately sending money to less people than the Trump administration and the Senate majority Republicans were willing to -- there are going to be about 17 million people who will get less money.\" Omar seemed to be referring to numbers\u00a0from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning think tank. An analysis by the group estimated that\u00a0under the Senate package, 11.8 million fewer adults and 4.6 million fewer children would be able to obtain direct payments than would have been able to under the House's version. BIDEN TIGHTENS $1,400 STIMULUS CHECK INCOME LIMITS AMID PRESSURE FROM MODERATE DEMS \"This is not the promise that we made,\" she added. \"This is not what we are given the opportunity to be in the majority in the Senate and have the White House. And so, ultimately it is a failure when we compromise ourselves out of delivering on behalf of the American people and keeping our promises.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP She added that Democrats couldn't\u00a0blame Republicans for \"our inability to deliver on the promises that we made.\"\u00a0 \"This is just us now negotiating amongst ourselves,\" she said.\u00a0\"The House is controlled by Democrats, the Senate is controlled by Democrats, the White House is in the hands of an administration that is a Democrat and so I don't know how this makes any political sense and it certainly does not make any policy sense.\" Sam Dorman is a reporter with Fox News.

        "text": "Games\nSenator Mike Braun says Nancy Pelosi's attempt to push a $3T stimulus coronavirus package is completely out of line House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday defended the $3 trillion price tag of the latest coronavirus relief bill, saying that \u201cthe American people are worth it.\u201d Pelosi, D-Calif., in an interview with The Associated Press\u00a0said\u00a0the newly proposed coronavirus stimulus package was needed to confront the \u201cvillainous virus\u201d that is coronavirus, which has caused the country\u2019s economic decline. STIMULUS CHECKS, STATE AID AND MORE: WHAT\u2019S IN HOUSE DEMOCRATS' NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL \u201cThis is the biggest disaster that our country has ever faced,\u201d Pelosi told the AP. \u201cThe president calls it a war \u2014 we\u2019re all warriors, that people are dying in the war. No these are family, and people are dying in the family.\u201d She added: \u201cWe have to address in a big way. The American people are worth it.\u201d The new bill introduced this week is more than 1,800 pages long and has a price tag of nearly $3 trillion. The package, called the HEROES Act, includes more direct payments beyond the $1,200 check most Americans received under the CARES Act, which passed in March. The new bill offers another $1,200 payment for each family member in a household, totaling up to $6,000. The bill allocates nearly $1 trillion to state, local and tribal governments for \u201chonoring our heroes.\u201d The bill also creates a \u201cHeroes Fund,\u201d which provides $200 billion to essential workers who worked during the pandemic as hazard pay. The bill also extends the Paycheck Protection Program and adds $10 billion in COVID-19 emergency grants. The bill extends unemployment benefits of $600 payments, in addition to state benefits, through January 2021, creates a special enrollment period in Affordable Care Act exchanges for the uninsured, provides $175 billion for families to\u00a0pay their mortgages and rent, and increased maximum SNAP benefits, which are currently $768 a month, by 15 percent. The bill also adds $75 billion to \u201censure every American can access free coronavirus treatment,\u201d and to expand testing and contact tracing. TOP GOP REP BLASTS DEMOCRATS' $3T BILL, AS 'RECIPE FOR A PROLONGED RECESSION' Republicans are blasting the legislation as a \"recipe for a prolonged recession.\u201d Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, accused Democrats Wednesday of being\u00a0more concerned about helping special interests than getting the economy back up and running before the 33 million Americans who are temporarily\u00a0jobless become permanently out of work. \"The word 'cannabis' appears more times in Democrats' bill than the word 'job',\" said Brady, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. Brady also took issue with the House Democrats' plan to repeal the $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions that he pushed through during the Trump tax cut program. Lawmakers from high-tax states like New York and California were incensed that the federal government would no longer allow taxpayers in those states to get a full deduction for\u00a0state income\u00a0and local property taxes. The House is set to pass the package Friday. As of Wednesday, the U.S. reported more than 1.3 million positive cases of COVID-19 and more than 82,800 deaths.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., offered sharp opposition to the president's decision to not automatically sign the legislation. In an interview with ABC's \"This Week,\" Sanders said he agrees that the payments should be higher, but the president should not hold up the current bill in order to make it happen. PELOSI PLEDGES HOUSE VOTE ON $2000 CHECKS AS MONDAY SHUTDOWN DEADLINE LOOMS\u00a0 \"What the president is doing right now is unbelievably cruel,\" Sanders said. \"Many millions of people are losing their extended unemployment benefits, they\u2019re going to be evicted from their apartments because the eviction moratorium is ending, we are looking at a way to get this vaccine distributed to tens of millions of people. There\u2019s money in that bill and this president is diddling around and he may actually veto it.\" Despite the harsh criticism, Sanders recognized that he and Trump do agree in principle that $600 would not be sufficient. BIDEN CALLS ON TRUMP TO SIGN COVID RELIEF BILL AMID BATTLE OVER DIRECT PAYMENTS \"But you can\u2019t diddle around with the bill,\" Sanders said. \"Sign the bill, Mr. President, and then immediately, Monday, Tuesday, we can pass a $2,000 direct payment to the working families of this country.\" Sanders' sentiment was similar to that of his Republican colleague Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., who told \"Fox News Sunday\" that Trump should sign the bill and then push for separate action on the payments. Toomey, however, is opposed to increasing the payments, preferring a targeted approach that would specifically assist those suffering financial losses due to the coronavirus pandemic. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Consider the millions of federal employees who never missed a check,\" Toomey said. \"Their expenses were probably somewhat diminished.

Kevin Brady, R-Texas, accused Democrats Wednesday of being\u00a0more concerned about helping special interests than getting the economy back up and running before the 33 million Americans who are temporarily\u00a0jobless become permanently out of work. \"The word cannabis appears more times in Democrats' bill than the word job,\" said Brady, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee. HOUSE DEMS UNVEIL CORONAVIRUS BILL ESTIMATED TO COST $3T, IN LARGEST STIMULUS PACKAGE YET Cannabis shows up 68 times in the 1,815-page legislation. Job or jobs shows up 52 times. Brady said the Democrats' plan is merely\u00a0a \"show vote\" that is \"dead on arrival\" once it reaches the Senate. Brady could find little in the bill he\u00a0likes and expressed doubt on whether\u00a0another round of stimulus is even needed. The centerpiece of the bill is nearly $1 trillion to state and local governments to plug budget holes and prevent layoffs of public workers, like first responders and teachers. Then, the House Democrats plan another round of $1,200 stimulus checks\u00a0per person\u00a0to an expanded pool of recipients. DEMOCRATS' $3T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL EXTENDS STIMULUS CHECKS TO CERTAIN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS Brady doesn't support either of those provisions and took issue with certain undocumented immigrants having eligibility for the $1,200 checks under the plan. \"I think our main focus needs to be getting people back to work,\" Brady said. \"I\u00a0think that's\u00a0the key both short term and long term for the economy and for families as well. I don't agree with expanding this to those who were not here legally ... You are inviting more fraud in the tax system.\" Brady railed against the\u00a0House Democrats' plan to repeal the $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions that he pushed through during the Trump tax cut program. Lawmakers from high-tax states like New York and California were incensed that the federal government would no longer allow taxpayers in those states to get a full deduction for the hefty taxes\u00a0they\u00a0pay on their state incomes and local property taxes. \"The rollback on SALT is a giveaway to millionaire households while it gives a green light for local governments to tax their\u00a0families and workers even more,\" Brady said. STIMULUS CHECKS, STATE AID AND MORE: WHAT\u2019S IN HOUSE DEMOCRATS' NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL Brady called out the cannabis provisions as an example of the House's special interest giveaways. The coronavirus legislation includes provisions to allow legal cannabis businesses to use traditional banking services. Since marijuana is still federally illegal and federally backed banks won't do business with marijuana sellers,\u00a0cannabis\u00a0has largely been a cash-only industry. Lawmakers from states that have legalized pot have pushed for legislation to open up the banking industry for marijuana dispensaries.\u00a0\u00a0In September, the House passed the SAFE Banking Act with broad bipartisan support, but it went nowhere in the Senate. The author of the bill, Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo., cheered that his cannabis legislation made it into the $3 trillion coronavirus bill. Like other small businesses, cannabis employers\u00a0are hurting and need help, too, he said.

        "text": "Games\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls the bill a starting offer as the White House issues a veto threat; Mike Emanuel has the details. Several Democrats are bucking their party and voting against Speaker Nancy Pelosi's $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill in the House on Friday. Some moderate members in swing districts -- including Reps. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Joe Cunningham of South Carolina,\u00a0Kendra Horn of Oklahoma, Cindy Axne of Iowa and Ben McAdams of Utah--\u00a0ripped the massive\u00a0measure as a one-sided partisan bill that is going nowhere. And there's resistance in the most liberal wing of the party, too, where some say the $3 trillion measure isn't big enough. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a\u00a0leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said her \"no\" vote was \"difficult\" but the bill fell short on ensuring Americans continued to get paychecks and had access to health care. DEMOCRATS' $3T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL EXTENDS STIMULUS CHECKS TO CERTAIN UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS At least one Republican, Rep. Peter King of New York, is bucking the GOP and supporting the legislation that will give nearly $1 trillion to state and local governments reeling from coronavirus budget holes. \u201cI can be as much a red state person as anyone. But now we're talking about survival. And this is no place for politics. There's a lot in the bill that I disagree with, but Mitch McConnell refuses to bring up aid to state and local governments. New York will absolutely collapse if that aid money is not there,\u201d King told Fox News. The Democratic Party defectors first appeared during a vote Friday morning when 14 Democrats voted against their party on a procedural resolution, including moderates, progressives and the liberal freshman squad: Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. AOC CITES NEED TO 'PLAY HARDBALL' ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF PACKAGES, IN PUSH FOR $2,000 PER MONTH PAYMENTS Ocasio-Cortez, whose Bronx and Queens district has been especially hard hit by the virus, said the bill\u00a0is a \"mixed bag\" \u00a0with positive funding for hard-hit state and local governments but falls shorts on direct assistance and health care. \"Do I\u00a0think it should be bolder?\u00a0Yes,\"\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez told reporters outside the Capitol, wearing a \"Medicare For All\" blue mask.\u00a0\"Do I think there should be more, especially as a starting offer. Absolutely. But I do anticipate that there's going to be some sort of deal on the other end.\" On the flip side, moderate Democrats who were elected in 2018 during the blue wave were upset the legislation was drafted without input from Republicans, unlike the previous four bills that passed with broad bipartisan support. \u201cThis is Washington politics at its worst,\" Cunningham, D-S.C., said in a statement.\u00a0\u00a0\"While South Carolina families, small business owners, and workers are struggling, now is not the time to advance a partisan wish list or refuse to come to the negotiating table. At a time when our country is in real trouble, we should not be spending precious time on one-sided solutions that aren\u2019t going anywhere.\" STIMULUS CHECKS, STATE AID AND MORE: WHAT\u2019S IN HOUSE DEMOCRATS' NEW CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL Spanberger said voters in her Central Virginia district expect the government to work together during the crisis. \"Unfortunately, many members of Congress \u2014 including some in my own party \u2014 have decided to use this package as an opportunity to make political statements and propose a bill that goes far beyond pandemic relief and has no chance at becoming law, further delaying the help so many need,\" Spanberger said in a statement announcing her \"no\" vote. Horn, another freshman rep who won in a red district in 2018, said the $3 trillion package, known as the HEROES Act, is full of \"pet projects\" that are unrelated to the coronavirus crisis and is too costly. \"This is not the time for partisan gamesmanship, this is the time to find common ground and deliver help where it is needed most,\" Horn said. \"In response to COVID-19, our relief efforts must be targeted, timely, and transparent. The HEROES Act does not meet those standards.\" DEMOCRATS' $3T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL IS TOO SMALL FOR SOME PROGRESSIVES On the liberal side of the Democratic Party, progressive members wanted reoccurring $2,000 monthly paychecks, expanded access to Medicare and inclusion of the\u00a0Paycheck Guarantee Act\u00a0that Jayapal had introduced. That paycheck legislation was designed to ensure workers were paid and attached to their employers' health care during the pandemic to avoid layoffs, business closures and more unemployment claims. The plan called for the federal government to give grants to employers to cover 100 percent of employees' benefits and salaries (up to $100,000 per person) for the next three months. \"This was a difficult decision for me,\" Jayapal told reporters Friday at the Capitol. \"There are a lot of things that are good in the bill.\" Fox News' Lindsay Carlton and Kelly Phares contributed to this report.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here.\u00a0 Forty-five million borrowers maintain over $1.6 trillion in student loan debt and, with unemployment numbers growing amid the coronavirus pandemic, the situation has left Americans wondering just how they are going to pay even one more bill. Know who your provider is because if your loan is through the federal government, help has arrived. The CARES Act coronavirus stimulus bill was signed into law last month and it enables borrowers to suspend payments on federally held student loans until Sept. 30, giving people a six-month reprieve. According to the bill: There will also be no interest accrued during those six months.\u00a0Furthermore, any borrower who has defaulted on that federally held student loan will not have their tax refund withheld, wages garnished, or social security payments withheld.\u00a0Collection calls are even put on hold. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\u00a0 Betsy Mayotte of The Institute of Student Loan Advisors says this is \"significant relief for the majority of student loan borrowers.\"\u00a0Mayotte, who has been a student loan advocate for decades, said: \"I was in it during 9/11. I was in it during Katrina. And I have never seen such a significant relief package being offered to student loan borrowers.\" And these relief waivers are just what University of Massachusetts senior Julia Cassiani says she needs right now.\u00a0Planning for her future during coronavirus has been one of the most stressful things Cassiani has had to deal with.\u00a0College ending abruptly was one thing but looking for a job during an unstable economy worries her more. \"It's going to be very hard to get a job,\" Cassiani explained. \"You see everyone getting laid off from a lot of jobs and it makes you hesitant to even bother trying because you know there's not much room for you there.\" Planning to earn a degree in sustainable food and farming next month, Cassiani will hold close to $40,000 in student loan debt.\u00a0Cassiani said she was going to go the traditional route for her payment plan but that was before this pandemic upended the class of 2020's world. MEET THE FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER WHO IS CHALLENGING THE CORONAVIRUS NARRATIVE \"I had this original idea in my head.\" Cassiani said, \"it would take me about 20-25 years to pay off my loans.\"\u00a0Now, she sees hope in this federal act because \"with some of this relief, it will take less time\" to pay off her student debt. Mayotte cautioned that there are still about 25 percent of borrowers that aren't going to receive relief from these federal waivers because those individuals took out a loan through their state or directly from their institution or even a private bank. She\u00a0said borrowers should check with their loan provider and ask if their loan qualifies Her other advice is to be patient. \"What I'm seeing is a lot of anxiety.\"\u00a0Mayotte explained \"people are looking at their accounts saying, 'oh, you know, they screwed up because I'm still accruing interest.'\" Student loan lenders have until April 11 to inform borrowers of whether they are covered.

Senate Democrats are prepared to work long nights and through the weekend to push through President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief legislation, determined to outlast an onslaught of expected GOP delay tactics. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., is threatening to have Senate clerks read aloud\u00a0the entire bill, which could eat up an estimated 10 hours of time. And Republicans are poised to offer a flurry of amendments to force Democrats to take painful votes during a so-called \"vote-a-rama.\" Democrats, however, say they'll be fueled with coffee and energized by what they say is widespread support for the legislation from the American people to get them through the expected long nights. \"They can keep us up all night,\" said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. \"They can keep us\u00a0until Sunday, doesn't matter. We're going to just keep drinking coffee and getting this thing done.\" SENATE GOP BLASTS 'BLUE STATE BAILOUT' IN BIDEN'S $1.9T CORONAVIRUS BILL There\u00a0are 20 hours of debate allotted for the coronavirus legislation, and then the marathon voting session on amendments will kick off where Republicans can offer unlimited proposals and force Democrats to take politically tough votes on everything from abortion to border security. Senate Republicans plan\u00a0to unleash a \"maximum pressure, maximum exposure\"\u00a0strategy as Democrats try\u00a0to get the bill over the finish line,\u00a0according to Stephen Bradford, a spokesman for the Senate Republican Conference.

Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called out Johnson and Republicans willing to go to\u00a0\"some pretty ridiculous lengths\" to oppose a bill that's popular with the public.\u00a0\u00a0 He said Democrats are \"delighted\" that Johnson wants to give the American people a chance to hear what's in the bill because there's \"overwhelming support\" for direct stimulus checks, unemployment insurance, food aid, rental assistance, vaccination distribution\u00a0and resources for schools and local governments.\u00a0 He said causing\u00a0\"sore throats for the Senate clerks\" still won't stop the bill's\u00a0passage. \"No matter how long it takes, the Senate is going to stay in session to finish the bill \u2013 this week,\" Schumer said Thursday. \"The American people deserve nothing less.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republican senators\u00a0overwhelmingly have panned the $1.9 trillion bill as a liberal wish list that has little to do with coronavirus.\u00a0 Johnson said\u00a0he feels bad for the clerks who will have to read the entire bill on the floor, but he said it's important to expose the massive spending overreach\u00a0that will saddle future generations with more debt. \"All I'm trying to do is make this a more deliberative process [and] obviously shine the light on this abusive and obscene amount of money,\" Johnson said Thursday. BIDEN BLOCKS $1,400 STIMULUS CHECKS FOR 16M AMERICANS AFTER TIGHTENING INCOME ELIGIBILITY The House already approved its coronavirus relief legislation, which included a $15\u00a0minimum wage that was stripped in the Senate. Senate Democrats are also making changes to the bill on state and local aid, narrowing\u00a0the eligibility for stimulus checks, adding relief funding for tourism losses\u00a0and other issues.\u00a0 Any bill approved by the Senate would have to head back to the House for passage before going to Biden's desk for his signature.\u00a0 Marisa Schultz is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital.

        "text": "Games\nReaction and analysis from 'The Next Revolution' host Steve Hilton and GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn. Top Democrats are poised to introduce legislation that aims to\u00a0provide\u00a0$3,600 per year for millions of families that have children under the age of six as part of President Biden's\u00a0nearly $2 trillion coronavirus relief package, according to a report Sunday. The Washington Post reported that it obtained the 22-page bill set to be introduced on Monday. The paper said that under the plan, families with children under six would receive $3,600 per child from the Internal Revenue Service; families with older children could receive $3,000. The amount depends on last year\u2019s earnings. The Post reported that there is a lot at stake for Democrats regarding the legislation and its success or failure could have ramifications in the 2022 congressional elections because it could affect so many families. The bill is expected to hit resistance among Republicans. Under the House Democrats\u2019 plan, the amounts\u00a0would begin to phase out for individual parents earning $75,000 yearly and couples pulling in\u00a0$150,000. All families would receive the full amount, even if they owe no federal income taxes, and payments to families would be made monthly. Democrats are moving to fast-track\u00a0Biden's pandemic relief plan, with the Senate approving\u00a0a budget resolution last week\u00a0that allows them to pass the measure\u00a0without any Republican buy-ins using a procedural tool known as \"reconciliation.\"\u00a0 WHO WILL RECEIVE A THIRD STIMULUS CHECK? WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR The legislation is expected to allocate\u00a0$160 billion for vaccine distribution, boost expanded unemployment benefits to\u00a0$400 a week through September and include\u00a0a third stimulus check worth $1,400. It will add to the nation's already-ballooning deficit, which hit a record $3.1 trillion in fiscal year 2020, not including the $900 billion relief package passed in December. Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, said, \"The pandemic is driving families deeper and deeper into poverty, and it\u2019s devastating.\u00a0This money is going to be the difference in a roof over someone\u2019s head or food on their table.\" SENATE SIGNALS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR MORE TARGETED $1,400 STIMULUS CHECKS The New York Times reported that some Democrats want to make the legislation permanent in order to fight poverty in the U.S. GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republicans, concerned about the national debt,\u00a0are prepared to contest the legislation. Sen.

President Trump said Monday his administration is considering a second round of coronavirus stimulus payments. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about that,\u201d Trump said when asked about a Democratic proposal to send another round of relief checks. \u201cWe're talking about that with a number of different people. We're talking about a payroll tax,\u201d the president said. \u201cI want to see various things, but we're talking about that. We're negotiating with the Democrats.\" Phase 3 of coronavirus stimulus, signed into law in late March, included $1,200 payments to many individuals. Trump has repeatedly called for payroll tax cuts to be included in Phase 4 of coronavirus stimulus. In\u00a0Phase 3, employers received a payroll tax cut, but the president is working to ensure that employees are covered by that tax cut in Phase 4 -- especially as individuals become eligible to return to work. TRUMP SAYS STATES WILL BE ABLE TO TEST MORE PEOPLE IN MAY THAN SOUTH KOREA IN TOTAL\u00a0 Trump has also repeatedly called for Phase 4 stimulus, which he said could amount to another $2 trillion, to focus on infrastructure. \u201cWith interest rates for the United States being at ZERO, this is the time to do our decades long awaited Infrastructure Bill,\u201d Trump tweeted April 17. \u201cIt should be VERY BIG & BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4.\u201d Trump on Friday said he was in \u201cno rush\u201d to negotiate the next phase of a coronavirus stimulus bill. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t say that we're in a rush. We were in a rush to get the money out to people, now we have gotten the money out,\u201d the president said, referring to the $2.2 trillion stimulus he signed into law in late March. The small business stimulus was replenished with another almost $500 billion in late April. The House has yet to unveil its massive fifth round of coronavirus relief-- another multi trillion dollar bill-- but Democrats have been eyeing more direct payments to Americans or expanded unemployment benefits, as well as more help for small businesses, and a major focus on funding for state and local governments. Many Republicans have been skeptical about bailouts for \u201cpoorly run\u201d states with large pension deficits and other financial issues that predate coronavirus. \u201cWhy should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois, as example) and cities, in all cases Democrat run and managed, when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help?\u201d the president tweeted. Meanwhile, progressive Democrats led by Sen. Bernie Sanders have been advocating not just for a second round of direct payments but for $2,000 monthly payments for the duration of the pandemic.

        "text": "Games\nFox News contributor and former Obama economic adviser Robert Wolf says Congress needs to give more federal aid to medical workers and states and larger direct payments to unemployed Americans. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. Two Democrats in the House don\u2019t think the $1,200 that many Americans will receive as part of the massive $2.2 trillion CARES Act that Congress approved last month is enough. Reps. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., introduced on Tuesday the Emergency Money for the People Act which wants to give millions of Americans $2,000 per month during the coronavirus pandemic. The lawmakers argue that with the record numbers of Americans unemployed, the one-time payment from the CARES Act is not sufficient. \u201cA one-time, twelve hundred dollar check isn\u2019t going to cut it,\u201d\u00a0Khanna said in a statement. \u201cAmericans need sustained cash infusions for the duration of this crisis in order to come out on the other side alive, healthy, and ready to get back to work.\" The legislation would drastically expand not only the amount of money Americans would receive, but how many Americans would\u00a0be eligible to qualify for the payments. GYM FRANCHISE OWNER: COVID-19 STIMULUS 'NOT WORKABLE' FOR OUR INDUSTRY Under the CARES Act, people who file their taxes as individuals are eligible for a one-time payment of up to $1,200, and couples who file jointly are eligible for up to $2,400 plus an\u00a0additional $500 per child under the age of 17. The amount decreases for individuals who earn an adjusted gross income of\u00a0more than $75,000 and couples who earn more than $150,000 a year, by $5 for every $100 in income above those marks. This means the payment is less the higher their earnings are, with it being reduced to zero for individuals\u00a0who make $99,000 or more and couples who make $198,000 or more. The Emergency Money for the People Act, however, wants to bump the payment to $2,000 every month until employment returns\u00a0to pre-COVID-19 levels. Every American age 16 and older making less than $130,000 annually would be qualified to receive\u00a0the money, and married couples earning less than $260,000 would receive at least $4,000 per month. Qualifying families with children will receive an additional $500 per child, with families being eligible to receive funds for up to three children.

Some 16.8 million Americans have lost their jobs in the last three weeks \u2013 meaning one in 10\u00a0working Americans is out of a job.

        "text": "Games\nArkansas Sen. Tom Cotton reacts to Congress looking to pass $22B more on COVID relief on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\u00a0 As Republicans take control of committee gavels in the House of Representatives, there is a wide array of topics ripe for oversight and investigation. But one item that should be at the top of their agenda is the massive fraud in pandemic-era federal relief programs, especially involving unemployment benefits. The federal government\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic unleashed unprecedented demand for unemployment benefits starting in March 2020. Congress responded with record benefit expansions, including adding $600 per week to all unemployment checks. Claims for state and federal unemployment benefits quickly surged to 33 million in June 2020\u2014more than double the prior record. In all, nearly 1.6 billion unemployment checks worth $900 billion were paid out through Labor Day 2021. An individual collecting just average unemployment benefits nationwide throughout that time received $46,000 in checks\u2014plus thousands more in stimulus checks and other government benefits.\u00a0 Those huge payouts\u2014and serious weaknesses in federal temporary benefit program design\u2014attracted criminals intent on ripping off the system. The new federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program was the most vulnerable to abuse. It offered weekly checks to independent contractors, the self-employed, and others who worked too little to qualify for regular state Unemployment Insurance (UI) checks. In contrast with UI, PUA allowed claimants to self-certify their eligibility and initially did not even require proof of prior work or adequate identity verification. As the Department of Labor\u2019s (DOL\u2019s) Inspector General (IG) summarized, PUA was \"extremely susceptible to improper payments and fraud.\" How much was stolen? Official estimates\u2014which admittedly understate real losses\u2014are staggering. The DOL IG estimates $163 billion was lost, including to fraud. That is based on an estimated improper payment rate of 18.71 percent from July 2020 to June 2021. But that misses the massive spike in claims early in the pandemic, along with losses under the PUA program, which was most prone to abuse. Counting those factors, unofficial loss estimates range to as high as $400 billion, or an astonishing 40 percent of all benefits paid. Significant shares were likely stolen by overseas criminal gangs, including in China and Russia. Most fraud involved the use of stolen identities to falsely claim benefits. Colorado officials reported in September 2020 that more than 75 percent of PUA claims \"were determined to be fraudulent.\" In August 2020 an implausible 80 percent of all 3.4 million workers in Arizona appeared to have applied for unemployment benefits. California PUA cases doubled to almost 7.0 million in just two weeks in August 2020, forcing state officials to admit that \"a big part of the unusual recent rise in PUA claims is linked to fraud.\" Taxpayers deserve to know how their dollars were spent\u2014and too often wasted. State and federal officials owe it to them to recover fraudulent funds whenever possible and ensure that systems are strengthened so this sort of rip off never happens again. That must be a big part of the oversight Congress performs this year. Legislative changes are needed, too. Future benefits should be paid only after confirming claimant identities and prior work, and never based on \"self-certification.\" Recipients should again search for work while claiming benefits. And states must systematically confirm that benefits are not paid to prisoners, dead people, people claiming benefits in multiple states, and current workers. Lawmakers should also recognize that states currently have little incentive to recover misspent federal funds. Such recoveries require state effort and administrative expense, only to have any recovered federal funds be turned over to the feds in the end. House and Senate Republicans have proposed the Chase COVID Unemployment Fraud Act, which would allow states to retain 25 percent of any misspent federal funds they recover. States could use those funds to modernize their systems and improve program integrity. That offers gains for taxpayers and rightful recipients alike.\u00a0 The coronavirus pandemic was an historic economic event, and the policy response to it resulted in record assistance for the unemployed, along with record fraud. This won\u2019t be the last time the nation turns to its unemployment benefits system to offer extraordinary support for laid off workers. We must learn from this response to not only recover as much as we can now, but also ensure future benefits are better protected from abuse. That will better meet the needs of the unemployed and protect the interests of taxpayers who support these important benefits.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. President Trump on Thursday urged schools across the country to reopen amid the coronavirus pandemic as long as they can practice good hygiene and social distancing -- adding that the White House is asking Congress to pledge $105 billion to schools as part of next coronavirus stimulus bill. The president, who has for weeks been pressuring schools to reopen and \u201cget our economy going,\u201d added during a coronavirus briefing at the White House that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will release new guidelines to ensure the safe reopening of schools. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield has recently emphasized that his agency\u2019s guidelines were only recommendations, and he urged schools to find ways to reopen while minimizing the spread of COVID-19. \"Nothing would cause me greater sadness than to see any school district or school use our guidance as a reason not to reopen,\u201d Redfield said.  PENTAGON PLANNING TO OPEN SCHOOLS ON MILITARY BASES WORLDWIDE THIS FALL\u00a0 The White House, however, has blocked Redfield from testifying before Congress next week regarding how to safely reopen schools. Trump said that if schools don't reopen, he wants parents to get the funding to send their kids to public or private schools that will reopen.  \"The money should follow the student,\" he said, adding that the funding should go to private, charter\u00a0or religious schools if public institutions don\u2019t open. A number of districts including Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Atlanta and Baltimore plan to begin the school year fully online. A number of others, including Chicago, New York City and Philadelphia have announced hybrid online and on-campus learning plans.  The White House has said it is up to localities to decide in what capacity they open schools in the fall, but Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding if schools do not reopen in the fall. Trump also announced that\u00a0he was canceling the Republican National Convention events that were scheduled to take place next month in Jacksonville, Fla. -- citing the rising numbers of COVID-19 in the state. \u201cThe timing for this event is not right, it\u2019s just not right,\u201d Trump said during a press briefing at the White House. \u201cTo have a big convention, it\u2019s just not the right time.\u201d Trump added: \u201cThere is nothing more important in our country than keeping our people safe.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Republican National Committee (RNC) last month chose Jacksonville to host major portions of the convention, after largely abandoning the city of Charlotte, N.C., over disagreements on coronavirus-related crowd restrictions. The president and Republican officials were angered after Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat, said that because of the pandemic\u00a0he wasn\u2019t prepared to guarantee the RNC a full-fledged convention with an arena packed full of\u00a0party officials, delegates and activists as desired by Trump. While the Jacksonville portion of the convention has been canceled, Trump said that delegates will still meet in North Carolina and that he will give an address when he accepts the nomination. Trump added that officials need to set \u201ca good example\u201d and couldn\u2019t have hundreds of people gathering in Florida as he asks schools to be careful when opening schools. \u201cHere we are saying that schools should reopen, but then we have a lot more people at the convention,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to set a good example.\u201d Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A GOP-led Senate bill\u00a0designed to protect small businesses during the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic may be a crucial point\u00a0in whether lawmakers reach an agreement on extending\u00a0economic relief before the 2020 presidential election. As American families and small businesses suffer under both the pandemic and efforts to contain it, the July\u00a0bill has emerged at the center of lawmakers' debates on relief. MNUCHIN: GOP, PELOSI TO AGREE ON CONTINUING RESOLUTION TO AVOID SHUTDOWN, AS STIMULUS TALKS STALL Senate Bill 4317, or the SAFE TO WORK Act, was co-sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Tex., to discourage \"insubstantial lawsuits relating to COVID\u201319 while preserving the ability of individuals and businesses that have suffered real injury to obtain complete relief.\" Critics\u00a0however, argue that the legislation would provide immunity from suits under the guise of protecting health care professionals and precluding\u00a0unsubstantiated COVID-19 claims. \"In its entirety, the preponderance of provisions contained in\u00a0the bill is nothing more than a business liability shield,\" University of New Haven economics and business analytics professor Brian Marks argued in a Monday op-ed in The Hill. The law, he said, is an attempt to distract from the issue. The \"health care professional is trying to provide care and treatment for COVID-19, and the liability shield could result in the spread of COVID-19 because of the moral hazard problem created by the shield.\" Marks said the law would shift responsibility and COVID-19 risks from firms and companies to employees and consumers and that the result would \"not necessarily be conducive to a safe and secure work environment.\" \"This bill is misguided, misdirected, and misnamed if the objective is to provide a safe and secure environment,\" Marks concluded. However,\u00a0a Senate leadership aide\u00a0rejected Marks' argument, telling Fox News on Tuesday that claims the bill \"provides what is tantamount to absolute immunity from COVID-19 related lawsuits under the pretense of precluding unsubstantiated COVID-19 claims and protecting health care professionals\" are false. \"One of the central points of the McConnell-Cornyn bill is to create a federal cause of action for medical malpractice suits. The bill is expressly authorizing those suits,\" the aide said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had similar criticisms during an appearance on MSNBC in July, and both The Washington Post and Politifact gave him negative marks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (Associated Press) McConnell, Cornyn\u00a0and Senate Republicans backing the bill say the provisions are crucial to facilitating\u00a0the U.S.\u00a0reemergence from the pandemic-linked recession or \"economic storm.\" McConnell has previously told CNBC that\u00a0he would not bring up a coronavirus aid bill in the Senate unless it includes liability protection. With Democrats\u00a0still pushing for the $3 trillion HEROES Act\u00a0passed in the Democratically controlled Hosue and Republicans looking for a price tag no larger than $1 trillion, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told FOX\u00a0Business' Maria Bartiromo Tuesday morning that he was optimistic that something would get passed before the November election. Treasury Secretary\u00a0Steven Mnuchin\u00a0said on\u00a0\"Fox News Sunday\" that\u00a0while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0is refusing to negotiate a new deal\u00a0unless Republicans are willing to spend at least $2.5 trillion, she has agreed to a continuing resolution that will keep the government from shutting down. In a statement released later\u00a0Tuesday, McConnell announced Republicans would introduce a new, targeted proposal and that\u00a0he would be\u00a0moving immediately to set up a floor vote. \"Everything Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer have done suggests one simple motivation: They do not want American families to see any more bipartisan aid before the polls close on President Trump\u2019s re-election. They have taken Americans\u2019 health, jobs, and schools hostage for perceived partisan gain,\" McConnell said. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\u00a0 While little is known about the future of COVID-19 litigation and The Wall Street Journal says\u00a0employers are \"rarely \u2026 found liable for employee deaths tied to the workplace,\"\u00a0legal experts have warned the\u00a0trend could reverse because early liability lawsuits filed against employers are focused on whether employers followed state and federal guidelines. Hunton Andrews Kurth, a multinational law firm that primarily represents corporate clients, reported that as of late August about 499 employment and labor lawsuits claiming that employees were exposed or potentially exposed to the new coronavirus had been filed. At the end of the month, there had been 4,655 legal complaints filed since\u00a0Jan.\u00a030\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the date the first legal complaint in the database was filed \u2014\u00a0relating to the disease. Although the trend has notably increased,\u00a0about 16 million civil lawsuits\u00a0were filed in state trial courts in 2018, according to the Conference of State Court Administrators and the National Center for State Courts.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here If Americans don't receive their stimulus checks during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, they will break quarantine guidelines and go to work and potentially worsen the crisis, Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy said Wednesday. In an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" with co-host Brian Kilmeade, Kennedy said that it's hard for moving parts to be perfectly coordinated government\u00a0but that the money needs to immediately make it into the hands of the American people. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE \"I'm not going to criticize anybody. I think state government, local government, federal government, President Trump -- everybody is doing the best they can,\" he remarked. \"Ideally, it would be the preferred route to have one purchaser of the ventilators: the federal government. But, I understand when governors want\u00a0 to be proactive and want to go out on their own.\" \"We're using about 30 percent of our ventilators right now,\" Kennedy continued. \"It's not like we're out. But, we worry, like everyone else does, about running out. Because we don't want to have to make a decision -- our health care professionals don't -- of who lives and who dies. I think we'll beat this thing if everybody will respect what the scientists tell us.\" Kennedy pointed out this is why the unemployment compensation program is so important. \"If people can't pay their rent or buy food, they are going to go back to work which means they are going to come out of quarantine,\" he explained. \"And, that's why we need to get that money to people.\" Last week the president\u00a0signed a more than $2 trillion emergency relief bill. For individuals who earned less than $75,000 in 2019, the bill would send out one-time payments of $1,200 for a single household, $2,400 for couples, and $500 per kid nationwide. For incomes more than $75,000, payments would be reduced by\u00a0$5 for every $100 of income that exceeds the limits. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday the checks will be sent out \"within three weeks\" to people for whom the IRS already has banking\u00a0information. However, the discussion in Congress has since shifted to a \"Phase 4\" rescue plan with Trump pushing a $2 trillion infrastructure package. \"Well, number one, I'm not interested in any more of Speaker Pelosi's spending porn or any other member of Congress for that matter,\" Kennedy asserted. \"Number two: we just spent, with the leverage,\u00a0$4 trillion. We ought to see if it works.\" CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP \"So, I think we need to slow down and be mindful of what we're doing and let's see if what we just did works,\" he added. \"I think it will if we can get the money out to people.\" \"We're going to beat this thing, but we're going to have to do it together and we're not going to do it just throwing money at it,\" Kennedy concluded.

        "text": "Games\nDuring an interview on Wednesday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the White House and the Democrats are \u2018miles apart\u2019 over the coronavirus economic relief package for Americans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday that Democratic leaders and White House officials remain far apart regarding any deal to provide more emergency aid to American families and workers still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re miles apart,\u201d Pelosi told MSNBC during an interview on Wednesday, citing, in particular, a stalemate over education funding, eviction protections and additional money for food stamps. Negotiators are trying to bridge the divide between a $1 trillion aid package put forward by Senate Republicans at the end of July,\u00a0and the\u00a0$3\u00a0trillion legislation passed by House Democrats in May. The Trump administration rejected an offer by Pelosi last week to meet in the middle on a $2 trillion price tag. WASHINGTON IMPASSE ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF THREATENS US ECONOMY \"It's a chasm,\" Pelosi said. Talks between the two sides\u00a0broke down last Friday, putting at risk potentially trillions\u00a0of dollars in aid for families, businesses and the U.S. economy, including a fresh round of $1,200 stimulus checks, extra unemployment aid for millions of\u00a0out-of-work Americans and\u00a0$100 billion to help reopen schools. There have been\u00a0no signs of a d\u00e9tente so far, with each party continuing to blame\u00a0the other for the stalled-out discussions. Earlier in the day, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, one of the lead negotiators on the Republican side, urged Democrats to\u00a0compromise on a $1 trillion relief\u00a0package. MCCONNELL OPENS DOOR TO EXTENDING $600 UNEMPLOYMENT BOOST \"My view on negotiations\u00a0is you agree on the things that you can agree on, half legislation that's\u00a0good for the American public, and then come back for another bill,\" Mnuchin told FOX Business' Maria Bartiromo. Facing a deadlocked\u00a0Congress, President Trump acted unilaterally on additional virus relief over the weekend, signing four executive actions on Saturday that\u00a0would postpone the collection of payroll taxes for individuals earning less than $104,000 annually through the remainder of the year; partially restore supplemental unemployment benefits at $400 per week (25% of which would come\u00a0from cash-strapped state's budgets), extend student loan relief and discourage evictions. Combined, the four measures would inject about $165 billion of liquidity\u00a0into the U.S. economy in the short term and add about $10 billion to the nation's ballooning deficit, according to new\u00a0projections\u00a0released by the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget. SQUAD MEMBER ILHAN OMAR IN PRIMARY SPOTLIGHT AS 5 STATES HOLD CONTESTS TUESDAY\u00a0 Trump has pledged to pursue a permanent cut to the payroll taxes, but without legislation, those payments will still be required by the delayed due date. Some of his proposals are expected to\u00a0face legal challenges. Critics say the Constitution gives Congress the power of federal spending, meaning that Trump does not have the legal authority to issue executive orders allocating\u00a0how much money should be spent on the pandemic.

McFarquhar was dissatisfied with the money allocated to \"small businesses\" and said that families need better support amid the pandemic. \"I don\u2019t understand how this is going to help small businesses. I thought it was supposed to be for small businesses and for the American people. I don\u2019t know about you, but I don\u2019t know what $600 is going to really do for a family of four. I have four daughters so I just am appalled.\u00a0 TEXAS REPUBLICAN: PROCESS ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL WAS DISGRACE TO TAXPAYERS In addition to reviving a federal unemployment boost for millions of out-of-work Americans and sending a second $600 stimulus check to individuals, including children, the $2.3 trillion catchall package, which will\u00a0fund the government for the remainder of the fiscal year,\u00a0addresses a spate of legislation on taxes, energy, education and health care.

Congress overwhelmingly passed the bill, which became available to lawmakers just a few hours before they were expected to vote on it \u2014 to the chagrin of\u00a0Rep.

Shelley Moore Capito, R-W. Va., said the\u00a0Democratic coronavirus stimulus bill was a \"non-starter\" on Friday, calling it \"bloated\" and a wasted opportunity to work across the aisle. \"The\u00a0package is just\u00a0bloated with a trillion dollars\u00a0of extraneous items that are not for the\u00a0targeted emergency relief that\u00a0the 10 of us Republicans went\u00a0to the White House to offer,\" she said on \"America's Newsroom.\"\u00a0\"We see the numbers today.\u00a0The economy is recovering.\u00a0More people are working. \"There still is a lot of help to\u00a0be done and certainly on the\u00a0health side and on the\u00a0unemployment side.\u00a0We were willing and ready to go\u00a0there.\u00a0But when we have all these\u00a0other things in there to the\u00a0tune of a trillion dollars, that's a non-starter for me.\" SENATE COMPLETES READING 628-PAGE COVID-19 BILL House Democrats passed their own version of Biden's\u00a0$1.9 trillion stimulus, but Senate Democrats already axed the $15 minimum wage passed in their own proposed version of the\u00a0enormous legislation. Republicans have criticized other items in the legislation as wasteful, such as paying federal employees whose children aren't in school full-time and billions for schools that haven't spent\u00a0money already allocated to them. \"This was the perfect bill to\u00a0demonstrate to the country that\u00a0we can and will work together, and we have the best intentions\u00a0to try to solve this pandemic\u00a0issue.\u00a0This was where we should have\u00a0joined together,\" Capito said. BIDEN BLOCKS $1,400 STIMULUS CHECKS FOR 16M AMERICANS AFTER TIGHTENING INCOME ELIGIBILITY Capito has visited the White House twice since President Biden took office and described him as open to negotiation with Republicans, but she suggested left-wing pressure is thwarting\u00a0his deal-making instincts. \"He seems willing to negotiate ... I think the forces that are pushing him are a little bit stronger than what his natural inclinations are.

        "text": "Games\nRep. Brad Wenstrup, R- Ohio, on President Biden's coronavirus relief plan and increasing the federal minimum wage. EXCLUSIVE: The largest conservative caucus in the House is circulating a new playbook on how to fight back against President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill by exposing each of the ''liberal goodies\" tucked inside the package.\u00a0 The Republican Study Committee (RSC) authored a three-page memo to conservatives to outline\u00a0\"all the left-wing items Democrats are hoping the public won\u2019t find about.\" Fox News first obtained a copy of the fact sheet\u00a0that is slated to be widely circulated Monday. Among the provisions raising eyebrows among the conservatives are $1,400 stimulus checks going to mixed-status families with undocumented immigrants;\u00a0allowing Planned Parenthood to receive Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds designed to keep small businesses afloat; and nearly $600 million for additional emergency paid family leave for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers, according to the RSC memo. HOUSE COVID BILL INCLUDES OVER $100 MILLION FOR CONTROVERSIAL SILICON VALLEY UNDERGROUND RAIL PROJECT The memo also calls out\u00a0subsidies and loan forgiveness to farmers and ranchers on the basis of race and ethnicity;\u00a0allowing coronavirus funding to go to colleges that have\u00a0partnerships with Chinese-controlled companies and Confucius Institutes; and doling out\u00a0$50 million for environmental justice grant programs, which the RSC pans as \"a thinly-veiled kickback to leftist environmental groups.\" The RSC memo raises concerns over\u00a0extending PPP business funding to owners who could have a felony record, including \"violent criminals,\" and extending Medicaid eligibility for incarcerated inmates during the 30 days prior to their release. Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., does a television interview in the Capitol on Wednesday, Sept. 27, 2017. (Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call) (Getty Images) Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., the chairman of the RSC, said taxpayers need to know what's hidden in the package.\u00a0 REP. JIM BANKS, CHAIR OF LARGEST HOUSE CONSERVATIVE CAUCUS, PREVIEWS GOP AGENDA POST TRUMP \"The RSC is leading conservatives inside and outside the Beltway in opposition to this so-called \u2018relief package.\u2019 The more we learn about it, the worse it sounds,\" Banks told Fox News. \"That\u2019s why we\u2019ve put together a fact sheet to educate Americans exactly how their taxpayer dollars are being spent by Democrats.\" The House Budget Committee on Monday will take\u00a0up the $1.9 trillion coronavirus plan, and the full House could vote on the legislation later in the week. House GOP Whip Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., already told his Republican conference\u00a0to vote \"no,\" and he dubbed\u00a0the legislation \"Pelosi\u2019s Payoff to Progressives Act.\" SCALISE RIPS BIDEN SCHOOL-REOPENING GOAL: 'YOU'RE AFRAID OF STANDING UP TO THE TEACHERS UNION' The 591-page bill was released on Friday. The package includes the work of nine House committees that drafted various sections based on their area of jurisdiction.\u00a0 President Joe Biden walks with Albert Bourla, Pfizer CEO, right, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, second from right, and Jeff Zients, White House coronavirus response coordinator, as he tours a Pfizer manufacturing site, Friday, Feb. 19, 2021, in Portage, Mich. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (AP) The Biden administration and Democrats say the relief bill is necessary to reopen schools, deliver a financial\u00a0lifeline to\u00a0struggling families,\u00a0speed up the health care response,\u00a0help state and local governments and assist small businesses.\u00a0 \"We are in a race against time, and aggressive, bold action is needed before our nation is permanently scarred by the human and economic costs of inaction,\" said House Budget Committee chairman John Yarmuth, D-Ky. Overall, the House legislation would provide $1,400 stimulus checks to adults and their dependents, with\u00a0individuals making less than $75,000 and married couples earning less than $150,000 seeing the full amount. But the checks would phase out more quickly\u00a0and cut off at incomes higher than\u00a0$100,000 for individuals and $200,000 for couples filing jointly. The legislation extends federal\u00a0unemployment compensation\u00a0through Aug. 29 at a rate of $400 per week, up from the current $300. BIDEN'S $1.9T STIMULUS WOULD GIVE ALMOST $3,600 TO POOREST AMERICANS, ANALYSIS FINDS The duration of the two main federal unemployment programs would also be lengthened.\u00a0The Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program would be extended from 24 to 48 weeks. And the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program would extend from 50 to 74 weeks. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The legislation would\u00a0gradually\u00a0raise\u00a0the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 and\u00a0guarantees that tipped workers, youth workers and\u00a0workers with disabilities are paid the full federal minimum wage. The $15 wage provision, however, may not survive in the Senate. The coronavirus relief package also includes\u00a0$350 billion to state and local governments,\u00a0$130 billion for K-12 schools and $40 billion for colleges and universities. The bill\u00a0expands the child tax credit, housing assistance, food aid and health care programs, too. Marisa Schultz is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital.

        "text": "Games\nRepublican Sen. Ted Cruz reacts to the news on 'Fox &amp; Friends' as lawmakers try to pass a 'phase 3.5' coronavirus stimulus package to help small businesses. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reportedly will propose a measure that would block President Trump from having his name appear on any future coronavirus relief checks, as part of a potential \u201cPhase 4\u201d stimulus package. Politico reported the provision will be titled the \u201cNo PR Act,\u201d and would ban the use of federal funds to promote Trump or Vice President Pence\u2019s names or signatures. TRUMP'S NAME TO APPEAR ON CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS CHECKS \u201cPresident Trump unfortunately appears to see the pandemic as just another opportunity to promote his own political interests,\u201d Schumer, D-N.Y., told\u00a0Politico. \u201cThe No PR Act puts an end to the president\u2019s exploitation of taxpayer money for promotional material that only benefits his re-election campaign.\u201d He added: \u201cDelaying the release of stimulus checks so his signature could be added is a waste of time and money.\u201d Schumer\u2019s expected provision comes after the president\u2019s name appeared on millions of economic stimulus checks sent to Americans as part of the \u201cPhase 3\u201d coronavirus relief package, which totaled more than $2.2 trillion counting the relief payments and a variety of other programs. The president\u2019s name appeared on paper checks going to some Americans, while others received their relief payments via direct deposit. The president\u2019s name, \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump,\u201d appeared in the memo section on the left hand side of those paper checks, but his signature was not included. Those who received their payment via direct deposit did not have anything including Trump\u2019s name. It is not standard practice for the name of the president to appear on government checks. At the time, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., blasted the president\u2019s decision to put his name on the check, saying: \u201cDelaying direct payments to vulnerable families just to print his name on the check is another shameful example of President Trump\u2019s catastrophic failure to treat this crisis with the urgency it demands.\u201d Meanwhile, Schumer\u2019s proposal also comes as Congress has implemented several avenues to conduct oversight of the Trump administration\u2019s response to COVID-19. Last week, the House approved the creation of a committee, chaired by Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., to oversee the federal response, even as Republicans blasted the idea as politically motivated and argued Democrats would use it as a forum to attack the president. Pelosi\u00a0said the committee was designed to address the \u201chere and now,\u201d specifically concerning the allocation of the historic amount of federal funds directed to the economic recovery. She compared the panel to the committee chaired by then-Sen. Harry Truman in 1941 to investigate waste, fraud and abuse in defense spending in the early days of World War II. \u201cAgain, this isn\u2019t about assigning blame,\u201d Pelosi said on the House floor Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s about taking responsibility.\u201d WHITE HOUSE SAYS PAYROLL TAX CUT FOR EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN 'PHASE 4' CORONVIRUS STIMULUS PACKAGE Pelosi added that the committee \u201cwill ensure the historic investment of taxpayer dollars are being used wisely and efficiently and nobody is ripping us off.\u201d And earlier this month, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Sens. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., also\u00a0announced their intention to create a 9/11-style commission, set to launch in February 2021 \u201chopefully after the pandemic has been overcome and after the presidential election.\u201d That commission would be granted subpoena power to compel cooperation from federal, state and local government officials, as it examines government preparedness in advance of the pandemic. Meanwhile, the president signed into law a nearly $500 billion \"phase 3.5\" emergency interim relief bill on Friday, and a \"Phase 4\" bill could follow.

President Trump, for his part, has responded to the crisis by cracking down on both illegal and legal immigration \u2014\u00a0slapping travel bans on China, Iran and the European Union\u00a0and limiting entry on land borders to the north and south, while border officials are\u00a0immediately returning illegal immigrants and asylum seekers to their home countries. HOUSE DEMOCRATS' CORONAVIRUS PACKAGE INCLUDES 'AMNESTY' FOR SOME ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, CRITICS SAY Democrats, however, are taking the opposite approach. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., have introduced\u00a0a bill that would release immigrants in detention into the country, and halt any immigration enforcement against anyone not deemed a \u201csignificant\u201d threat to public safety. \u201cWe have an obligation to do everything we can to prevent the spread of this deadly disease, and that means moving people out of detention centers when they do not pose a public safety risk,\u201d Booker said in a statement. \u201cThis is really a matter of life and death: it\u2019s time that we act quickly and decisively to save as many lives as possible, and that means ending the unnecessary detention of immigrants during this public health crisis.\u201d Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Democrats are demanding that the next round of stimulus checks include illegal immigrants by modifying\u00a0a requirement that recipients have a Social Security number to receive one. DRUG CARTELS AT THE BORDER TRYING TO 'EXPLOIT' CORONAVIRUS CRISIS, CBP CHIEF SAYS A $3 trillion bill passed by the Democratic-controlled House last week would allow the $1,200 stimulus checks to go to those who also pay income taxes via an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) \u2014\u00a0which is used by people who are ineligible for a Social Security number, including illegal immigrants. As partial justification, Democrats have pointed to so-called mixed families, in which there are American citizens or legal permanent residents, as well as illegal immigrants, in one family. They file using an ITIN and so far have not been eligible for aid. \u201cThe Supreme Court ruled that children, undocumented children should have a right to education in our country. Why not then should citizens\u2019 children, children in taxpayers\u2019 families, not have the opportunity to the checks that they need?\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0said on a press call this month. But it\u2019s an idea that has drawn strong criticism, even mockery, from Republicans who believe that aid should be reserved only to citizens and those here legally. \u201cCan you believe it? We forgot to have the Treasury Department send money to people here illegally.\u00a0My goodness. What an oversight,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor last week. The bill also included protections for \u201cessential critical infrastructure workers\u201d that would allow some illegal immigrants employed as such to be placed into \u201ca period of deferred action\u201d and be authorized to work if they meet certain conditions. It also grants protections to those employers who hire illegal immigrants, stating that \u201cthe hiring, employment or continued employment\u201d of the defined group of illegal immigrants is not in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The move was flagged by Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli as a push by Democrats to grant \"amnesty\" to illegal immigrants and protection to those who employ them. \u201cIs it really a good idea to not only grant an amnesty to illegal aliens but to absolve employers who have been breaking the law in the last few months?\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI don't think so!\u201d SEATTLE CITY COUNCIL CALLS FOR $100 MILLION 'RELIEF FUND' FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS Meanwhile, some state governments have been seeking to make sure illegal immigrants receive money and argue they should have been included in the last round of stimulus. The Seattle City Council is calling on Washington state to create a $100 million \u201crelief fund\u201d for illegal immigrants who did not qualify for the federal stimulus checks issued last month. The city\u2019s council passed a resolution Monday asking Gov. Jay Inslee to create a \u201cWashington Worker Relief Fund\u201d to provide \u201ceconomic assistance to undocumented Washingtonians during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d Meanwhile\u00a0in California, the state has opened up about $75 million for a fund to help roughly 150,000 illegal immigrants in the state. It gives them access to a coronavirus relief program that will pay $500 per person and up to $1,000 per household. The developments come as Democrats continue to shift left on immigration issues\u00a0to the backdrop of the presidential race, drawing contrasts with Republicans who, along with the Trump administration, have advocated even tougher policies. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Democrats have opposed a host of Trump\u2019s border security measures, including the wall at the southern border and the \u201cRemain-in-Mexico\u201d policy, while a number of top Democrats and presidential contenders have backed calls to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and to give health care and other social services to illegal immigrants. Presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, meanwhile, has been on record calling for health care for illegal immigrants, as well as a 100-day moratorium on deportations if he wins the election in November.

        "text": "Games\nFox News\u2019 Bret Baier reacts to President Trump calling the coronavirus relief bill a \u2018disgrace.\u2019 President Trump headed to Palm Beach, Fla., Wednesday to celebrate Christmas\u00a0with\u00a0coronavirus relief and government spending in limbo due to his dissatisfaction with the package.\u00a0 Trump will spend the holiday at his golf club resort\u00a0Mar-a-Lago.\u00a0 The president sent shockwaves throughout Washington Tuesday night when he pushed out a Twitter video of himself blasting the omnibus package. House and Senate leaders reached agreement on coronavirus relief after months of being at an impasse.\u00a0 TRUMP PUSHES FOR BIGGER STIMULUS CHECKS IN 11TH HOUR STIMULUS DEMANDS The president has five days to sign the bill or the government will shut down.\u00a0 He demanded lawmakers amend the coronavirus stimulus package they passed Monday to include $2,000 checks for individuals instead of $600 checks. He also\u00a0insisted that \"wasteful and unnecessary\" items be cut from the year-end spending package that was attached to the pandemic aid. The omnibus funding package, valued at $1.3 trillion was combined with the coronavirus stimulus bill, $900 billion, as Congress raced to get out of Washington\u00a0for Christmas. The funding package previously was negotiated in Congress, as lawmakers finally came to an agreement on coronavirus aid over the weekend. Combining the two allowed it to be done in one vote. \"I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000, or $4,000 for a couple,\" Trump said in his Twitter video. \"I'm also asking Congress to immediately get rid of the wasteful and unnecessary items from this legislation, and to send me a suitable bill or else the next administration will have to deliver a package, and maybe that administration will be me.\" Trump added: \"For example, among the more than 5,000 pages in this bill, which nobody in Congress has read because of its length and complexity -- it's called the COVID relief bill, but it has almost nothing to do with COVID.\" TRUMP'S CALL FOR $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS HAILED -- BY CRITICS PELOSI, AOC, SANDERS Trump has not issued a direct veto threat and still could sign the bill if lawmakers and their staffs don't come back -- although it is not clear if they will or not, according to congressional sources. He also could utilize a rare \"pocket veto,\" holding on to the legislation and refusing to act on it.\u00a0 That would force Congress to essentially start the legislative process all over. It would put the government at risk of a shutdown yet again, as it is currently operating on a seven-day interim spending bill.\u00a0 Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was quiet on his next steps after the president condemned the package. Democrats, meanwhile, basked in the president\u2019s call for greater stimulus funding. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said her chamber will try to pass a bill for $2,000 stimulus checks by unanimous consent, meaning if one member opposes the bill it fails.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By forcing a voice vote, Democrats goad Republicans to go against President Trump\u2019s wishes for larger checks.\u00a0 A Federal Aviation Administration alert restricts airspace over Mar-a-Lago resort until Jan. 1.

        "text": "Games\nAaron Bergh, owner of Calwise Spirits Co. in Paso Robles, says Gov. Newsom is standing in the way of businesses getting back on their feet.  SACRAMENTO, Calif.\u00a0\u2014 California lawmakers on Monday cleared the way for 5.7 million people to get at least $600 in one-time payments, part of a state-sized coronavirus relief package aimed at helping lower-income people weather what they hope is the last legs of the pandemic. The state Legislature passed the bill by a wide margin on Monday, moving faster than their counterparts in Congress who are also considering another round of stimulus checks for the nation. FAUCI CAUTIONS AGAINST EATING OUT, EVEN WITH VACCINE Gov. Gavin Newsom said he will sign it into law on Tuesday. People who are eligible for the money should get it at between 45 days and 60 days after receiving their state tax refunds, according to the Franchise Tax Board. One of those people is Judy Jackson, a 75-year-old former teacher and cancer survivor who lives off of about $1,000 a month from other government programs. Jackson said she would use part the money to pay off a freezer she bought so she could have food delivered to her home and avoid going out to shop for groceries during the pandemic. \"Most months I\u2019m worried at the end of the month whether the money is going to run out before the month does,\" said Jackson, who said she is at higher risk for COVID-19 because of her age and a number of underlying health conditions. \"This will make it possible to have a little extra and maybe buy an ice cream occasionally.\" PFIZER, MODERNA COVID-19 VACCINES SHOW NO SAFETY CONCERNS DURING FIRST MONTH OF ROLLOUT, CDC SAYS The stimulus payments are part of a broader aid package the state Legislature approved Monday worth $7.6 billion. It includes more than $2 billion in grants for small businesses, waives about $25.6 million worth of business fees for struggling restaurants and hair salons and provides $30 million in aid for food banks and another $5 million for diaper banks. The stimulus checks target fewer people than the federal stimulus payments last year. About $2.3 billion will go to those who claim and receive the California earned income tax credit. In general, that\u2019s people who earn $30,000 a year or less. Another $470 million will go to people who earn a maximum of $75,000 per year after deductions and use an individual taxpayer identification number to file their income taxes. These are mostly people who don\u2019t have Social Security numbers, including immigrants. Some people fit both of those categories. In those cases, they will get $1,200, not $600. The Democratic-controlled state Legislature did this because most people who file their taxes this way are immigrants who were not eligible for federal stimulus checks Congress approved last year. About $993 million will go to people who get help from state programs targeting low-income families, the elderly, the blind and the disabled. California has the money to do this in part because the state \u2014 the nation\u2019s most populous with nearly 40 million residents \u2014 has lots of wealthy people who have been less impacted by the pandemic and continue to pay taxes. California lost 1.5 million jobs last year, mostly lower-wage earners in the hospitality and restaurant industry. Meanwhile, employment among people who earn $60,000 a year or more went up last year as people transitioned to working from home. The result is California has an estimated $15 billion one-time surplus to spend this year, a number that could grow even higher later this year once more people file their tax returns. \"We need to acknowledge that this pandemic has not hit us all equally,\" said state Assemblyman Joaquin Arambula, a Democrat from Fresno. California has some of the most stringent coronavirus business rules in the country, banning indoor dining in much of the state and ordering retailers to limit the number of people allowed inside their stores. Last year, Newsom used his emergency authority to set aside $500 million for grants of up to $25,000 for small businesses impacted by the pandemic. But in the first round of funding, the state received more than 334,000 applications totaling more than $4.4 billion in grants. On Monday, the Legislature added another $2 billion to that program. Businesses that have between $1,000 and $2.5 million in revenue are eligible, and they must be open or at least have a plan to reopen when they are allowed. Assemblyman Mike Gipson, a Democrat from Carson, said small business owners in his district have been \"praying for an answer.\" \"This is the answer to their prayers,\" he said. But some Republicans, while voting for the bill, criticized Newsom for \"the hurt and harm\" he caused businesses by ordering statewide shutdowns during the height of the pandemic. \"This bill didn\u2019t have to be as big as it is today,\" said Assemblyman James Gallagher, a Republican from Yuba City. \"This governor arbitrarily and unilaterally decided to shut down most of the small business in this state. As a result, many businesses have already gone out of business and that should be a problem for every one of us.\" Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

        "text": "Games\nWest Virginia Democratic Senator Joe Manchin weighs in on coronavirus aid package and outbreak response. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. President Trump\u00a0on Wednesday signed the\u00a0second coronavirus relief bill into law\u00a0that provides\u00a0paid sick leave, unemployment help and free testing to Americans, the White House announced. The Senate passed the legislation in a 90-8 vote earlier Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., had criticized the legislation negotiated by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin as having \"real shortcomings\", but urged his members to \"gag and vote for it anyway\" to show\u00a0bipartisan cooperation during the global pandemic. \"This is a time for urgent bipartisan action, and in this case, I do not believe we should let perfection be the enemy of something that will help even a subset of workers,\" McConnell said Wednesday morning in announcing he'd vote for the House legislation. Two senators were absent \u2013 Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla.\u00a0\u2014 because of self-quarantining after exposure to people who tested positive for coronavirus. The eight senators voting no were all Republicans: Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Mike Lee of Utah, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Tim Scott of South Carolina. Critics said the mandate on small businesses to provide paid sick leave to workers was too much of a hardship when businesses are short on cash and can't wait for a federal tax credit reimbursement. \u201cSmall businesses in my state are closed,\u201d Lankford said after the vote. \u201c\u2026Many small businesses are really struggling with how they're going to pay for this when they have no income coming in right now. They are hearing the promise of a federal reimbursement coming to them, but they don't know when that's coming and they're literally teetering on the edge right now. And they're [saying]:\u00a0'Please don't do something that pushes us over the edge.'\u201d The legislation provides 14 days of paid sick days to workers affected by the coronavirus, ensures free testing to everyone, including the uninsured, and expands food aid and boosts unemployment dollars to states. WHAT'S IN THE CORONAVIRUS BILL BEFORE CONGRESS Next up, the Senate and White House have been moving quickly\u00a0to draft a third round of stimulus legislation that could infuse about $1 trillion into the U.S. economy that has been rattled by\u00a0school shutdowns, business closures\u00a0and steep declines in the\u00a0travel and tourism industry\u00a0as many Americans are stuck home. McConnell signaled Wednesday that\u00a0Senate Republicans were close to an agreement on the next round of legislation that would help businesses, American workers, health-care professionals and others hard hit by the public health emergency. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SEEKS 2 ROUNDS OF CHECKS TO AMERICANS IN MASSIVE CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE \"This will be needed to respond to the crisis,\" McConnell said before the Senate adjourned for the evening. \"The Senate's going to stay around until we finish the bill and send it over to the House. I recommend senators stay close while we don't know exactly how long it will take to get this done, everyone knows that we need to do it as quickly as possible because the situation demands it.\" The House and Senate already passed a bipartisan $8.3 billion package to prop up the health-care system to prepare for the influx of sick Americans. The second response bill that was signed into law Wednesday aims to bring\u00a0relief to workers who lost their jobs and families at home for illnesses, quarantines or caring for kids whose schools have shuttered. The legislation first\u00a0passed the House early Saturday morning with broad bipartisan support in a 363-40 vote. The legislation moved so hastily, bypassing the normal review processes, that the\u00a0House had to make corrections to the bill language Monday. Earlier Wednesday, the Senate defeated amendments to the House legislation that were offered by Paul, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., and a third by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. Now, all eyes turn to the\u00a0third round of stimulus that could\u00a0infuse Americans' bank accounts with direct cash payments, an idea pushed by the far left and the White House. The Trump administration has been seeking $250 billion in payments to Americans starting\u00a0April 6, followed by another $250 billion cash payment round beginning\u00a0May 18, according to the working draft of the plan obtained by\u00a0Fox Business. The two payments to taxpayers would be identical and the amounts would vary by family income and size, according to the Treasury Department document on the \"Stage Three\" coronavirus proposal. The Trump proposal\u00a0would provide $50 billion for lending to the\u00a0airline industry and another\u00a0$150 billion to \"other severely distressed sectors of the U.S. economy\" through secured lending or loan guarantees. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Trump administration also signaled it wanted $300 billion to help small businesses, which have suffered under social isolation and various cities banning\u00a0dine-in services at bars and restaurants in an effort to\u00a0prevent the spread of the COVID-19. The details of the plan are fast-moving and in flux. But McConnell pledged the Senate won't recess until another\u00a0round of stimulus is\u00a0passed.

        "text": "Games\nSen. John Kennedy says that the $2 trillion COVID relief bill is filled with unnecessary spending unrelated to coronavirus.  Sen. John Kennedy R-LA., blasted President Joe Biden\u2019s proposed $1.9\u00a0trillion COVID relief bill Wednesday, calling it \"chock-full of spending porn\" unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic. \"This isn\u2019t a coronavirus bill,\" Kennedy said on \"America\u2019s Newsroom.\" \"This is a left-of-Lenin, neo-socialist wish list.\" Kennedy asserted that the Biden administration\u2019s \"infantile\" approach to spending money is likely to continue after passing the coronavirus bill, with the introduction of a $3 trillion green energy bill.  \"The objective is not to spend money \u2013 it\u2019s not how much you spend, it\u2019s what you spend it on,\" Kennedy said. HANNITY: COVID AID BILL IS BOTH SOCIALIST 'WISH LIST' AND 'BAILOUT' TO DEMOCRAT-RUN STATES A large portion of the funding for the coronavirus relief bill would not be spent until 2022 and beyond. Kennedy added that the bill contains funding for transit projects, language preservation, and billions of dollars for people who have entered the country illegally. Many conservatives and moderate Democrats have criticized some aspects of the bill, including $1,400 stimulus checks going to mixed-status families with undocumented immigrants; allowing Planned Parenthood to receive Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds designed to keep small businesses afloat; and nearly $600 million for additional emergency paid family leave for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers, according to the RSC memo. As an example of what Kennedy considered mismanaged spending, he pointed to the allocation of $70 billion for K-12 school funding. Only $4 billion of the $70 billion has been spent with hundreds of billions more proposed to be sent to schools in the COVID relief bill, which is likely not to be fully spent until 2024. Some Democrats, including Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Kyrsten Sinema,, D-Ariz.,\u00a0have signaled they might not back the required $15 minimum wage in the bill, which jeopardizes the Democrat simple majority. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah,\u00a0criticized the bill for a third of its funds not being uused\u00a0until 2024 and the inclusion of unnecessary expenses.

The federal government has spent\u00a0trillions\u00a0of dollars to help dull the economic pain from the\u00a0coronavirus\u00a0pandemic, but Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio claims it\u2019s not enough to stabilize the economy \u2014 and wants to see monthly payments of $2,000\u00a0to most Americans until the crisis begins to fade. SUBSCRIBE AND DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS RUNDOWN \"I think this is the best way to stabilize the economy and make sure that everybody is paying their mortgage, paying their credit cards, paying their personal loans ... and all the rest so that they don't fall behind,\" Ryan said during Tuesday's Fox News Rundown\u00a0podcast. \"Once we do start unraveling the stay-at-home\u00a0orders, we need to make sure everybody has met their economic obligations up to this point,\" Ryan added, \"and that they have some money in their pocket so that we can actually have people going out to get the economy up and running.\" HOUSE DEMOCRATS PROPOSE $2,000 CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PAYMENTS PER MONTH Last month, Ryan and fellow\u00a0Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., unveiled the\u00a0Emergency Money for People Act, which would distribute cash payments to every American aged 16 or older who earns fewer\u00a0than $130,000 annually. The bill would distribute an extra $500 per child to families with\u00a0three or fewer children and would last for six months; a married couple who makes fewer than\u00a0$260,000 and has three children would receive $5,500 per month. Ryan acknowledged that\u00a0while his proposal would likely cost the government\u00a0\"in the trillions\" per month,\u00a0continued inaction would come at a far greater cost. SUBSCRIBE AND DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS RUNDOWN \"People say, 'Well, that's going to cost a lot of money.' And I say, 'You're absolutely right.' The only thing that would cost more is to do nothing and let us move from a\u00a0deep recession into a depression,\" Ryan said. \"We already have 30 million people that have filed [for] unemployment.\u00a0These frontline workers, these workers at the grocery stores that don't get paid very much,\u00a0they're working longer hours ... they're working hard. They're playing by the rules. And we're going to want them to have some money in their pockets, too, and a little 'thank you' for all the work that they're doing in the middle of this pandemic. So I think to me, it's straightforward.\" Although the $2.2 trillion CARES Act signed into law at the end of March included one-time payments of $1,200 for Americans earning less than $75,000 (and an additional $500 per child), Khanna and Ryan have argued it\u2019s not enough. The payments were\u00a0tapered for higher earners and phase out completely for individuals who earn more than $99,000. \u201cRent is due this week. Utilities are coming up. Americans need ...\u00a0cash, this month, next month, and every month after that until this crisis ends,\u201d Khanna tweeted last week. \u201cA single, $1200 check isn\u2019t going to cut it.\u201d \"I mean, it's a lot of money. I'm not here\u00a0to backpedal or sugarcoat this thing. It's a lot of money,\" Ryan said.\u00a0\"But the question is, just imagine all of these Americans who can't pay their mortgage, who can't pay their auto loan, who will be defaulting on some of these credit cards and all the rest. How are they going to climb out of that?\" The bill initially had 17\u00a0co-sponsors, all Democrats. But since it was introduced, the bill has gained an\u00a0additional 10 Democratic co-sponsors\u00a0and has been touted online by former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang, a prominent proponent of a universal base income.

Ryan also responded to\u00a0Senate\u00a0Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell's\u00a0statement\u00a0that he did not intend\u00a0to consider\u00a0legislation to provide additional federal funding to state and local governments who McConnell\u00a0said are trying to \"take advantage\" of the coronavirus crisis to get help with their ballooning deficits. \"That's appalling to me. I just think...he's gotta be disconnected from what's happening on the ground,\" Ryan said.

        "text": "Games\nPress chides president for saying masks voluntary. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. Saying\u00a0\"we hope we're seeing a leveling off in the hottest spots of them all,\" President Trump revealed Sunday evening that 1.67 million people have now been tested for coronavirus in the United States as the \"light at the end of the tunnel\" emerges\u00a0 -- although he made clear he felt some politicians have let their constituents down during the crisis. Trump further\u00a0signaled he'd be open to the government sending out an additional round of stimulus checks to Americans, saying: \"I like the concept of it.\" He added that the current round of stimulus money\u00a0should be distributed within two weeks. In the meantime,\u00a0Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker\u00a0was \"complaining all the time\" despite underperforming, Trump charged at a briefing with the president's coronavirus task force. The two officials have sparred in recent days, with the Democrat\u00a0accusing the White House of failing to provide all the ventilators he wanted. \u201cHe\u2019s not able to do what he\u2019s supposed to be able to do as a governor,\" Trump said. \"He has not performed well.\" Later during the briefing, Vice President Mike Pence said he had spoken to Pritzker, and the governor did \"express\u00a0great appreciation for the fact that our Army Corps of Engineers had constructed 500 beds at McCormick Place [convention center], and before the end of this week would construct another 2,500 beds for an overflow health facility in Chicago.\" Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u00a0said the Army Corps was \"outstanding,\" Pence noted. \"We have sent 600 ventilators to the state of Illinois, but I assured the governor,\u00a0 and I assured the mayor, that while the principle focus that we have in the next several days is the rising cases in the greater New York City area and Louisiana, that Michigan and Illinois are in the forefront of our thinking,\" Pence said. \"At the president's direction, we're gonna make sure that the people of Illinois and the people of Michigan have the resources, equipment\u00a0and support that they need.\" The flareup was notable given that some\u00a0prominent left-wing Democratic governors\u00a0have come to the president's defense. \"This is not time to bicker,\" California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said last Wednesday on CNN. \u201cLet me just be candid with you. I\u2019d be lying to you to say that [Trump] hasn\u2019t been responsive to our needs. He has. And so, as a sort of an offer of objectivity, I have to acknowledge that publicly.\" Newsom added: \"The fact is, every time that I've called the president, he's quickly gotten on the line. When we asked to get the support for that [USNS] Mercy ship in Southern California, he was able to direct that in real-time. We've got 2,000 of these field medical sites that are up, almost all operational now in the state, because of his support. Those are the facts.\" Also at the briefing Sunday, Rear Adm. John Polowczyk said U.S. operatives were going\u00a0to facilities in China to inspect all medical equipment\u00a0being sent to U.S. and make sure it is functional, amid reports that China has sent faulty testing kits and other supplies to several other countries. Additionally, Dr. Deborah Birx observed that\u00a0Spain and Italy have provided \"really helpful signs\" that social distancing was working, and new cases and deaths were declining in both countries. Birx said \"we're very hopeful\" over the next week that there will be a \"stabilization of cases across these large metro areas where the outbreak began several weeks ago.\" Spain and Italy were\u00a0\"giving us hope of what our future could be,\" she asserted. \"In the days ahead, America will endure the peak of this terrible pandemic,\" Trump said, before remarking that the end of the crisis could soon follow. FISHY: WOMAN WHO SAID SHE DRANK FISH TANK CLEANER BECAUSE OF TRUMP ACTUALLY HATES TRUMP Trump separately told reporters that an additional 600,000 N95 masks will be arriving to New York City on Monday \"to take care of the needs of the public hospital system,\" on the request of Mayor Bill de Blasio. Another 200,000 masks will be headed to Long Island\u00a0after officials there made the request, Trump added. Some 500 ventilators were on their way to New Jersey, 200 to Louisiana, 300 to Michigan, 600 to Illinois\u00a0and 100 to Massachusetts, the president said. Louisiana's Gov. John Bel Edwards\u00a0said earlier in the day that his state could run out of ventilators by Thursday. National Guard personnel walking outside the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans, after officials set up a temporary hospital there amid the coronavirus. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) Also on the way, Trump said, was more\u00a0hydroxychloroquine.\u00a0Limited studies\u00a0have suggested the\u00a0antimalarial drug could, in fact, treat coronavirus. Journalists who previously bashed the Trump administration for suggesting hydroxychloroquine have largely changed their tune. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, went from\u00a0threatening doctors\u00a0who prescribed the drug with \"administrative action\" to requesting that the federal government\u00a0ship her state\u00a0some. Other state leaders have followed suit, including Nevada Gov.\u00a0Steve Sisolak, also a Democrat.\u00a0And, an international poll of thousands of doctors\u00a0rated\u00a0hydroxychloroquine the \u201cmost effective therapy\u201d for coronavirus. \"We've bought a tremendous amount of the hydroxychloroquine,\" Trump told reporters, saying the country has stockpiled 29 million pills of the drug. \"There are some signs it works on this, some very strong signs. ... They're not expensive. What do you have to lose?\" The president noted he's \"not a doctor,\" but observed that the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] had issued emergency authorization for physicians to use the drug to treat coronavirus. JOURNALISTS CHANGE TUNE AFTER MOCKING TRUMP OVER CHLOROQUINE CLAIMS Pressed on whether he was irresponsibly offering medical advice, the president insisted he's \"not acting as a doctor,\" and said there were \"good signs\" the drug could save lives -- and at worse, it wouldn't cause deaths on its own. The drug requires a prescription regardless. In a surreal moment, a reporter then\u00a0bizzarely queried\u00a0Trump as to why all businesses, including essential ones like grocery stores, weren't forced to immediately close. Trump opened the briefing by offering words of hope for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalized Sunday after testing positive for coronavirus and exhibiting symptoms. \"All Americans are praying for him,\" Trump said. \"I'm hopeful and sure that he's going to be fine. He's a strong man, a strong person.\" Asked by a reporter whether he was thinking of standing apart from Pence \"to ensure continuity of government,\" Trump responded that \"sometimes we are forced into positions where I'd rather be away,\" but that it was \"very difficult\" sometimes to keep his distance from everyone else. The president said he was considering \"very substantial tariffs\" on foreign oil if the current price war were to continue. Trump added: \"I'd like to ask for your prayers for the families who have lost loved ones. Ask God to comfort them in their hour of grief -- it's a great hour of grief, for our nation and for the world. ... With the faith of our families and the spirit of our people and the grace of our God, we will endure, we will overcome, we will prevail. We have learned so much; we will be stronger than ever.\u201d The president also touted the news that\u00a0New York\u00a0state has seen\u00a0its first drop in daily coronavirus deaths, as U.S. Northern Command officials\u00a0said\u00a0it would deploy a combined total of\u00a01,000 Air Force and Navy medical providers to the New York City area to support relief efforts in the next three days. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat,\u00a0said earlier in the day that\u00a0New York also experienced a slight drop in intensive-care admissions and the number of patients who need breathing tubes inserted. The hospital discharge rate was \"way up\" he said, calling it \"great news.\" \"We sent federal troops -- not only troops, but a lot of talented doctors, nurses, first responders,\" Trump said. The\u00a0military\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0that the 1,000 personnel would work in support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA]. A total of 300 of these \"uniformed\u00a0medical providers will work from the Javits Center and the rest will deploy to other area locations to expand local medical capabilities in the war against COVID-19,\" U.S. Northern Command added. Americans were bracing for what the nation's top doctor warned Sunday would be \u201cthe hardest and saddest week\u201d of their lives while\u00a0Britain\u00a0assumed the unwelcome mantle of the deadliest coronavirus hotspot in\u00a0Europe\u00a0after a record 24-hour jump in deaths that surpassed even hard-hit\u00a0Italy.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0\u00a0Sign up here. Senate Armed Services Committee member\u00a0Tom Cotton, R-Ark., joined\u00a0\"Hannity\" Tuesday to discuss his proposed legislation that would prevent the federal government from sending taxpayer-funded stimulus dollars to states or cities that issue payments to people in the U.S. illegally. \"We shouldn\u2019t be spending hard-earned taxpayer dollars on illegal\u00a0immigrants at a time when 35 million\u00a0Americans are out of work,\" Cotton said. \"If we are going to be giving relief checks to those people who are out of work, we\u00a0need to focus on American\u00a0citizens, not illegal\u00a0immigrants.\" PENNSYLVANIA STATE SENATOR BLASTS STATE HEALTH SECRETARY'S HANDLING OF CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC Under Cotton's No Bailouts for Illegal Aliens Act, states or cities must certify that illegal aliens are not receiving coronavirus stimulus checks or other payments. State and city governments that refuse to comply with the certification requirements will not be eligible for funds from the CARES Act. Paycheck Protection Program loans, unemployment benefits and relief checks sent to American citizens in those locations would not be affected. \"New York, Illinois,\u00a0New Jersey, California\u00a0have some of the highest\u00a0state income taxes in the entire\u00a0country,\" host Sean Hannity told Cotton.\u00a0\"Now, there is more waste, fraud,\u00a0abuse, debt, deficits.\u00a0They are now trying to get\u00a0people like yourself and people\u00a0in red states that elect\u00a0responsible politicians\u00a0that\u00a0don\u2019t tax and spend to death to\u00a0bail them out. That means bailout their\u00a0stupidity. \"You talk about illegal\u00a0immigration,\" Hannity added.\u00a0\"How much is that costing the state\u00a0of California every year, the\u00a0state of New York every year?\u00a0A lot of money. Cotton also told Hannity that he is still looking to legislate a policy that will encourage domestic production of pharmaceuticals.

        "text": "Games\nCalifornia small business owner Pam Nusser slams Gov. Newsom for not helping the growing labor shortage California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Friday the state will expand small business pandemic benefits to $4 billion, and allocate an additional $1 billion to workers displaced during the pandemic. Small business owner Pam Nusser and gubernatorial candidate John Cox joined \"America Reports\" to respond to Newsom\u2019s legislation, arguing small businesses are competing with the government for workers. \"We have had ads for over two months for cooks and servers, and either we don't get any applicants or when we get them, they don't show up,\" Nusser said. \"People are demanding a certain amount of money per hour that is just totally ridiculous, or they are wanting cash. We can't compete with the government right now.\" Nusser emphasized that additional stimulus checks won\u2019t help small businesses. \"We don't want handouts. We want to work. We don't want to be applying, sitting there on our computers, applying for money. We don't need money. We need workers,\" Nusser said. GOP GOVERNORS REFUSE BIDEN'S UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS There are more than 8 million available jobs in the U.S., and a growing labor shortage as businesses have reported difficulty in onboarding new workers. \"We don't have enough employees to go to the tables and wait,\" Nusser said. \"It's just gotten insane because everybody is getting these checks. We want to work.\" Cox agreed with Nusser\u2019s sentiment, and said the cost of living in California has risen significantly as a result of Gov. Newsom\u2019s extended stimulus payments. \"Newsom is running around the state giving out money to people,\" Cox said, \"and what people don't realize is that the cost of living is soaring instead of doing permanent things that would reduce the cost of living and reduce tax burdens.\" Seventeen Republican-led states have now set deadlines ending federal unemployment benefits. GOP lawmakers held a press conference on Capitol Hill Thursday, calling on others to end the federal payments. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said many in his state are making equal or more money from weekly unemployment benefits instead of working. \"It\u2019s not because people are lazy, I am not accusing anyone of being lazy. It\u2019s because people are logical,\" Rubio said. GET THE FOX NEWS APP BY CLICKING HERE But Cox predicts the people of California will see through Newsom \"trying to buy votes.\" \"The people of this state, in particular in California, are going to rise up, and want a lower cost of living, lower taxes and a chance to have a good opportunity to have a small business just like Pam,\" Cox said.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0Sign up here. \u00a0 Former Vice President Joe Biden says the March unemployment report \u2013 which saw the nation\u2019s jobless level rise to 4.4 percent \u2013 is more evidence that another economic stimulus package is needed to help boost an economy savaged by the coronavirus pandemic. The Labor Department reported on Friday that more than 700,000 jobs were shed in March, the most in a monthly report since 2009 during the depths of the\u00a0Great Recession. But the new report doesn\u2019t include the roughly 10 million people who filed for unemployment benefits the past two weeks as the economy ground to halt while most Americans huddle in their homes to prevent the spread of the deadly COVID-19 disease caused by the virus. Those numbers will be reflected in a month in the April jobs report. U.S. EMPLOYERS SHED 700K JOBS AS JOBLESS RATE JUMPS IN MARCH \u201cThis morning's employment numbers are another clear warning sign that we need more action to stem the bleeding,\u201d Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, said. \u201cIt's a flashing red light we should not ignore.\u201d One week ago President Trump\u00a0signed into law a massive $2 trillion stimulus package known as the CARES Act that was overwhelmingly passed in a bipartisan vote by Congress. Biden says more needs to be done. \u201cThe CARES Act was an important step \u2014 and we\u2019ll begin to see it start helping, as long as it\u2019s implemented well \u2014 but it won't be enough. It's clear to me, and it should be clear to everyone, that a lot more is needed\u201d Biden said. And he urged that \u201cCongress must get to work immediately on the next package. We can't afford to waste time. There are a number of things that will have to be done all at once, but our economic priority must be to stop the bleeding in the labor market and keep as many people on payroll as possible.\u201d The need for another recovery package by Congress to help workers, small businesses and larger companies rebound is one area where Biden and the president seem to agree. \"With interest rates for the United States being at ZERO, this is the time to do our decades long awaited Infrastructure Bill,\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday. \"It should be VERY BIG & BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4.\"\nBut the top two Republicans in Congress \u2013 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California \u2013 right now are opposed to any quick move to pass another stimulus package. THE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN \u201cI think we need to wait a few days here, a few weeks, and see how things are working out,\u201d McConnell said this week on \"The Hugh Hewitt Show.\" And McCarthy, in a conference call with reporters, said that another stimulus package wouldn\u2019t be \u201cappropriate at this time.\u201d But Biden,\u00a0speaking with reporters on Thursday, was optimistic another measure would soon make its way through Congress. \u201cI predict to you that no matter Mitch says, he\u2019s going to be back handling another package. The idea that this is the end of it, I will be dumbfounded if that occurs. And disappointed,\u201d Biden said. Biden \u2013 who\u2019s repeatedly criticized Trump\u2019s handling of the federal response to the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 didn\u2019t take aim at the president in his statement Friday morning. But the Trump re-election campaign targeted Biden. \u201cThe American economy reached new heights under President Trump\u2019s leadership and he is clearly best suited to see our country through this difficult period,\u201d Trump 2020 communications director Tim Murtaugh touted. He then criticized Trump\u2019s all-but-certain Democratic challenger in the general election, saying \u201cJoe Biden, meanwhile, continues his useless partisan sniping from the sidelines, offering incoherent musings during friendly interviews in his futile quest to stay relevant. His record, overseeing the slowest economic recovery since World War II as Vice President and supporting job-killing trade deals like NAFTA and TPP, render him unqualified to lead in a time of economic crisis.\u201d Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

Andy Briggs, R-Ariz., sent a letter to the IRS Friday, demanding to know why the federal agency\u00a0failed to issue 2019 tax refunds and Economic Impact Payments authorized by Congress under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) in March. \u201cWe are currently living in unprecedented times. There are now 40 million unemployed Americans,\u201d said Biggs in his Friday letter. \u201cMy constituents do not have the luxury of waiting days for simple answers about the status of their filings, nor should they receive confusing or inconsistent guidance when they do finally receive responses.\u201d Biggs pointed to the fact that over 10,000 IRS employees are required to work from home right now,\u00a0which means people are unable to visit the Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TAC) to get direct answers regarding tax returns or to file paper tax returns. \u201cTwo months into the COVID crisis, the IRS still has not figured out a way to promptly return phone calls or finish processing paper refunds,\u201d Biggs told Fox News. \u201cGiven the billions of dollars East Valley residents are forced to fork over to the IRS each year, these are inexcusable shortcomings.\u201d \u201cI demand to know how [IRS] Commissioner Rettig intends to improve taxpayer services in the coming days and weeks,\u201d Biggs said to Fox News Friday. CORONAVIRUS MEANS EMPLOYERS CAN LET WORKERS MAKE CHANGES TO HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS, IRS SAYS Arizona has seen massive economic shutdowns due to the stay-at-home order issued March 31. The state\u2019s Department of Health Services reports that Arizona has had over 15,600 coronavirus cases and nearly 800 deaths.\u00a0But more than half of the state\u2019s cases have been in Maricopa County, where Rep. Biggs\u2019 district is located. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP The Bureau of Labor statistics also reported Friday, that Arizona had over a 12 percent unemployment rate during the month of April. \u201cFor better or for worse, the IRS provides and essential service,\u201d wrote Biggs. \u201cIf American citizens are asked to sacrifice some of their God-given liberty in the form of taxation, they should at least be granted the courtesy of prompt assistance.\u201d Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.

        "text": "Games\nA group of Republican senators have asked the Congressional Budget Office to calculate how much measures in the House stimulus bill that directly benefit illegal immigrants would cost the American taxpayer. \u201cIt is unfortunate that instead of working to help the American people, Speaker Pelosi and her majority in the House of Representatives are taking this opportunity to advance the economic well-being of illegal immigrants,\u201d Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C.;\u00a0Mike Lee, R-Utah;\u00a0Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; and Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., wrote in a letter to the CBO's director. HOUSE DEMOCRATS' STIMULUS BILL INCLUDES STIMULUS CHECKS FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, PROTECTIONS FROM DEPORTATIONS \u201dAmong other things, H.R. 6800 allows illegal immigrants to claim stimulus payments. In addition, Speaker Pelosi\u2019s bill also provides illegal immigrants with taxpayer funded healthcare services,\" they write. The HEROES ACT, which passed the House last week, includes a number of items that will benefit illegal immigrants, with a provision that would allows some illegal immigrants -- who are \u201cengaged in essential critical infrastructure labor or services in the United States\u201d --\u00a0 to be placed into \u201ca period of deferred action\u201d and authorized to work if they meet certain conditions. It also grants protections to those employers who hire those undocumented immigrants, ordering that \u201cthe hiring, employment or continued employment\u201d of the defined group is not in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act. That lasts until 90 days after the public health emergency is ended. It\u2019s language that was also included in the first House Democratic stimulus bill proposed back in May -- a bill that was ultimately rejected in the Republican-controlled Senate. Also in the legislation is language that would allow the a second round of stimulus checks, $1,200 per adults and $500 per dependant, to be extended to those without a social security number -- including those in the country illegally who file taxes via an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). The senators\u2019 letter also notes provisions that would give health care to illegal immigrants. \u201cWe are concerned these changes will not only impose additional fiscal burdens on our nation\u2019s budget but will also incentivize further unlawful immigration,\u201d they wrote. Among the questions they have for the CBO is how many illegal immigrants would be able to claim stimulus payments and how much it will cost, and how many illegal immigrants would benefit from the work authorization -- and the estimated impact that would have on the job market. \u201cIt\u2019s time the American people have a fuller understanding of exactly how much Speaker Pelosi\u2019s policies will cost them. While we have estimates of how much H.R. 6800 may cost in total, we believe Congress must know the costs of the specific provisions providing benefits to illegal immigrants,\u201d they said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Trump on Tuesday poured cold water on the chance of Republicans and Democrats coming to a deal on stimulus, saying that Pelosi was \u201cnot negotiating in good faith.\u201d \u201cI have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business,\u201d he said in a tweet.

The top two Congressional Democrats Thursday accused Republicans of trying to \"nickel and dime\" struggling Americans by\u00a0pushing for the smallest coronavirus relief bill possible and not understanding the gravity of the pandemic and economic fallout. The comments from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and\u00a0Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., at a Capitol news conference revealed Democrats are standing firm for a massive stimulus package, similar to House Democrats' $3 trillion HEROES Act, and have rejected GOP efforts to slim down the response. Pelosi said while there's been progress negotiating with Republicans, \"we're not there yet.\" She again refused to pass a short-term $600-per-week extension to the expired\u00a0unemployment benefits, arguing the need for a bigger\u00a0deal is the priority. \"We\u2019re not having\u00a0short-term extensions,\" Pelosi said. TRUMP THREATENS TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION IF DEAL ON CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILL NOT REACHED SOON Wednesday night, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said the White House and Democrats were still \"trillions of dollars apart\" on a deal. Meadows and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been negotiating on behalf of the White House with the Democratic leaders. Meadows accused\u00a0Democrats of not budging, while Republicans are searching for a compromise. \"I think it's fair to say that Republicans have made far more concessions than Democrats,\" Meadows told reporters. But Democrats said Republicans aren't grasping the scope of the problem. CALCULATE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'D RECEIVE FROM THE SECOND STIMULUS CHECK HERE \"They want to pinch pennies. They'd like to get away with passing the skinniest most minimal bill possible and go home and wash their hands of it,\" said Schumer, who referred to the GOP approach as a \"Band-aid.\" \"We can't do that because it will ... leave Americans hurting and not get us out of the crisis, which is our job.\" Pelosi and Schumer stood firm about the need for state and local funding,\u00a0rental assistance, more food aid, funds for voting by mail and the full $600-per-week federal unemployment insurance, which Republicans want to reduce because they view it as a disincentive to work. \"They are nickel and diming us,\" Pelosi, D-Calif., said. Without an immediate infusion of cash to help out-of-work Americans, hungry families and revenue-short local governments, Pelosi said the economic fallout will spiral downward. \"Think big because this is a big challenge and it will only get worse if we do not make the necessary investment,\" Pelosi said. \"Pay now or pay later -- much more later.\" NEARLY HALF OF US JOBS LOST TO CORONAVIRUS COULD BE GONE PERMANENTLY, POLL FINDS Talks between both sides are expected to continue through at least Friday.

The White House is emphasizing\u00a0that\u00a0it is considering changes\u00a0to \u201csanctuary\u201d cities as part\u00a0of the next round of stimulus, arguing that funding shouldn\u2019t provide relief for what officials described as \u201cbad Democratic governance.\u201d \u201cIn terms of the types of things [President Trump] wants to see in this Phase 4, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of the negotiations, but I do want to emphasize that he has mentioned sanctuary cities,\u201d White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said recently, referring to the next stage of stimulus. \u201cThis is a really important issue that has cost American lives.\u201d CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Sanctuary jurisdictions, that limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities in an effort to shield illegal immigrants from deportation, have long been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration. Pro-immigrant activists and many Democrats claim that the policies\u00a0make communities safer by encouraging illegal immigrants who are victims or witnesses of crime to come forward. But the Trump administration has pointed to heinous crimes committed by illegal immigrants who have been sprung from custody \u2014\u00a0and has sought to pull funds from such jurisdictions. Trump\u2019s recent objections appear to be more about alleged\u00a0financial mismanagement connected to the policy \u2014\u00a0possibly because many sanctuary states and cities will often grant public services and funding to illegal immigrants. GRANDDAUGHTER OF WOMAN ALLEGEDLY MURDERED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT IN NYC RIPS SANCTUARY CITIES AT TRUMP SPEECH Democrats have called for at least\u00a0$500 billion to be included for relief to state governments as part of the next stimulus package, something that has brought concern from Republicans that it could be an excuse to bail out states for past mismanagement on issues such as pensions and health care. \u201cWe'd have to talk about things like sanctuary cities, as an example,\u201d Trump said last week in the Oval Office. \"I think sanctuary cities is something [that] has to be brought up, where people that are criminals are protected. They're protected from prosecution. I think that has to be done. I think it's one of the problems that the states have.\u201d \u201cI don't even think they know they have a problem, but they have a big problem with it, the sanctuary city situation. We'd have to talk about a lot of different things. But we're certainly open to talking, but it would really have to be COVID-related, not related for mismanagement over a long time, over a long period of time,\u201d he said. REP MATT GAETZ UNVEILS LEGISLATION TO DEPORT ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DURING A PANDEMIC He also mentioned it at a business roundtable on Wednesday, suggesting aid should be withheld unless there are changes to sanctuary policies. \"I don't think you\u00a0should have sanctuary cities if they get that kind of aid,\" he said.\u00a0\"You know, if you're going to get aid to the cities and states of the kind of numbers you're talking about, billions of dollars, I don't think you should have sanctuary cities.\" The financial aspect was something McEnany emphasized on Friday. \u201cThe president has said, \u2018Look, I will certainly look to consider helping states who have coronavirus reasons for the financial situation they find themselves in,\u2019 but he doesn\u2019t want this to be an excuse for decades and decades of bad Democrat governance that have run some of these states into a financial predicament.\u201d CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Trump administration has made border security and immigration restriction a core part of its response to the coronavirus effort, from placing travel bans on countries like China and the European Union\u00a0to turning away illegal immigrants and asylum seekers at the border. Democrats, however, have been pressuring the administration to include some form of relief for those in the country illegally in the next round of stimulus. The initial round of stimulus checks went only to those with a Social Security number \u2014\u00a0something that excludes illegal immigrants, who are not eligible for a number.

President Trump\u00a0is balking at\u00a0massive legislation that includes $900 billion for coronavirus relief and a $1.4 trillion spending bill, but Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., thinks Trump should\u00a0just sign it despite his gripes. Toomey said that he, too, has problems with the legislation, but\u00a0enhanced unemployment\u00a0benefits expired Saturday and he believes the need for relief outweighs any\u00a0drawbacks. BIDEN CALLS ON TRUMP TO SIGN COVID RELIEF BILL AMID BATTLE OVER DIRECT PAYMENTS \"Look, if it were just the freestanding government funding bill, I would almost certainly be voting against that, but I think the COVID relief measures are really, really important,\" Toomey told \"Fox News Sunday.\" Toomey pointed to Americans who have been out of work due to the partial economic shutdown that resulted from the pandemic and the small businesses that are struggling to survive. \"I think we need the extended unemployment benefits.\u00a0I think we need another round of the loans, which were really grants to small businesses,\" Toomey said, noting that \"time\u2019s running out.\" The bill calls for $600 stimulus payments to be sent to all Americans, but Trump is now pushing for\u00a0$2,000 payments even though his White House negotiators signed off on the lesser amount.\u00a0 PELOSI PLEDGES HOUSE VOTE ON $2000 CHECKS AS MONDAY SHUTDOWN DEADLINE LOOMS\u00a0 \"I think what he ought to do is sign this bill and then make the case,\" Toomey said. \"Congress can pass another bill.\" Toomey said he disagrees with the idea of sending $2,000 checks to all Americans, given that not everyone is suffering financial losses from the pandemic. \"Consider the millions of federal employees who never missed a check,\" the senator said. \"Their expenses were probably somewhat diminished. Savings rates went through the roof. Why would we be sending several thousand dollars to these folks? This money isn\u2019t sitting on a shelf.\" Toomey then answered questions about Trump's string of recent pardons. While the senator\u00a0defended the pardon of disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Toomey said the others appeared to be a \"misuse\" of presidential pardon power. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I think the case of Mike Flynn, for instance, was completely legitimate to pardon him because the [Russia probe] prosecution was abuse of power. I don't think Michael Flynn ever committed a crime,\" he said. \"But some of these other cases, I mean, my goodness, we have tax fraud, bank fraud, witness tampering, obstruction of justice, but because they were close to the president they got pardoned.\" Toomey recognized that the pardons were constitutional, but said he believes some of them were \"a misuse of the power.\" Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI in connection with special counsel Robert Mueller's probe.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A stimulus package bill meant to boost the economy amid coronavirus fears will be introduced on the floor of the House Wednesday\u00a0but seems unlikely to include a temporary halt to the payroll tax that the Trump administration has been touting. The bill, which lawmakers have been furiously working on for days, comes as the U.S. economy and global markets have faced severe instability since the global outbreak of the coronavirus. \"We don\u2019t want to panic, but we don\u2019t want to give the impression this isn\u2019t a major heath challenge,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said on Wednesday, adding that the stimulus package will cost \u201cbillions.\u201d He added: \u201cIt will be much more costly if we don\u2019t provide the relief.\u201d CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Hoyer was firm that Trump\u2019s push for temporarily eliminating the payroll tax through the end of the year would not be included in the stimulus package bill, calling it a \u201cnon-starter\u201d and noting that the idea faces skepticism from both Democrats and Republicans. Trump on Tuesday pitched his economic stimulus ideas privately to wary Senate Republicans, but the president's GOP allies have been cool to additional spending at this stage. Democrats prefer their own package of low- or no-cost virus testing, unemployment insurance and sick pay for workers struggling to keep paychecks coming as the outbreak disrupts workplaces. White House officials have been blindsided by the president's sudden moves. As Trump headed to Capitol Hill, two administration officials said the proposals he was putting in play had not been completed. They were unauthorized to discuss the planning and requested anonymity. Details on the House stimulus package are scant, with Democrats saying only that the response is aimed at helping workers without paid sick leave and those facing temporary layoffs because of the outbreak rather than broader stimulus for the economy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said her goal is to pass a more narrowly drawn measure as soon as Thursday, before lawmakers leave town for a previously scheduled weeklong recess, and revisit potential stimulus measures later on, those familiar with the thinking said. Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s director of the National Economic Council, acknowledged on Tuesday that the payroll tax makes up an enormous amount of the money that goes into the federal budget. However, he said that it would provide a \u201cbig growth payoff\u201d to the economy and \u201chelp deal with the challenges over the next few months\u201d as the country battles the outbreak of the coronavirus. CORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN \u201cThe payroll tax holiday is a bold move and this has always been a bold president,\u201d Kudlow said, adding that the money lost from temporarily eliminating the tax will be made up \u201cwith much better economic growth.\u201d The payroll tax generated $1.17 trillion \u2013 or 35.2 percent of all federal revenues \u2013 in the fiscal year 2018,\u00a0according to a recent study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Most of the revenue from the tax goes to fund Social Security, Medicare, and other social insurance benefits. The suspension of the payroll tax would drop the tax rate from 14.2 percent down to zero, with the Trump administration hoping the extra money in people\u2019s paychecks will spur spending and boost an economy that has been on shaky ground since the outbreak of coronavirus in the U.S. Besides payroll tax relief, Trump has said he wants help for hourly wage workers to ensure they\u2019re \u201cnot going to miss a paycheck\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t get penalized for something that\u2019s not their fault.\" He's also mentioned small-business loans. But details are slight. As the House stimulus package gets hammered out, stocks opened with a sharp dive on Wednesday, nearly wiping out a huge rally from a day earlier as Wall Street continues to reel from worries about the coronavirus. Stocks fell from the opening of trading in New York, including a 4 percent fall for the S&P 500. The losses deepened as the day progressed, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 1,000 points. The speed of the market\u2019s declines and the degree of its swings the last few weeks have been breathtaking. It was only three weeks ago that the S&P 500 set a record high. Since then, it's lost roughly 18 percent, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has had six days where it swung by 1,000 points, not including Wednesday. The Dow has done that only three other times in history. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus, but the fear is that COVID-19 could drag the global economy into a recession by hitting it from two ends. On the supply side, the worst-case scenario has companies with fewer things to sell as factories shut down and arenas dim the lights because workers are out on quarantine. On the demand side, companies see fewer customers because people are huddling at home instead of taking trips or going to restaurants.

        "text": "Games\nIs temporary government relief being turned into a top-down reinvention of the U.S. economy? Insight from Fox News contributor Brian Brenberg, chair of the business and finance program at The King's College in New York City. Democrats are using coronavirus stimulus negotiations as an opportunity to push their big-government liberal agenda, The King's College Professor Brian Brenberg warned Saturday. In an interview\u00a0on\u00a0\"Fox & Friends Weekend,\"\u00a0Brenberg said he has been worried that efforts from politicians are not about recovery anymore. BRIAN BRENBERG: DEMOCRATS ARE USING CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS AS OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH THEIR BIG-GOVERNMENT AGENDA \"This is about a convenient\u00a0vehicle to get the Democrats'\u00a0progressive agenda through\u00a0Congress,\" he stated. \"I mean, you look at what we are talking\u00a0about right now,\" Brenberg pointed out. \"We are talking about things that\u00a0look like head-scratchers when\u00a0it comes to recovery.\u00a0We are talking about forgiving\u00a0student loans.\u00a0We are talking about massive new\u00a0programs for rent relief and\u00a0mortgages.\u00a0We are talking about another\u00a0round of stimulus checks.\" \"And, the question is, do these things\u00a0really help us recover?\u00a0Is this what the economy really\u00a0needs or is this just an opportunity\u00a0to get this progressive agenda\u00a0through by another means?\" he asked. \"Americans balked at the tens of\u00a0trillions of dollars of price\u00a0tag we saw with the Green New Deal and\u00a0now we\u2019re getting it on the\u00a0installment plan,\" said Brenberg. \"And, I think\u00a0America has to wake up to it.\u00a0I think Republicans in Congress have to\u00a0wake up to it.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill, Thursday, July 23, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)  \"We have to talk about real\u00a0stimulus or real relief -- what the\u00a0economy really needs and not\u00a0ideology right now,\" he asserted. In a new op-ed, Brenberg wrote that even as the economy speeds up ahead of the\u00a0fifth coronavirus stimulus bill, \"proposals for trillions of dollars more in government stimulus spending aren\u2019t slowing down.\" \"It\u2019s that clear progressive politicians have no intention to let go of the power they\u2019ve acquired during the pandemic,\" he penned. The solution Brenberg says is a \"pro-growth agenda.\" \"The only thing that helps people at\u00a0the end of the day is a growing\u00a0economy where businesses are\u00a0looking for workers and they\u2019re hiring\u00a0again,\" he told the \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" hosts. \"So, the measure we should be\u00a0using for everything in this\u00a0bill is does it grow the economy\u00a0or does it stall us out?\" \"So, we need to\u00a0have policy that gets people\u00a0back to work.\u00a0Republicans are talking about\u00a0some that are good: liability protection for\u00a0businesses.\u00a0We should be talking about ways\u00a0that we can put more money in\u00a0workers' pockets, [and] make it easier for businesses to\u00a0hire,\" Brenberg argued. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\u00a0 \"Republicans need to go to the\u00a0country with a pro-growth agenda, with something that gets people back\u00a0to work. That makes sense to\u00a0people intuitively.\u00a0They know pork when they see it.\u00a0And, they know growth when they\u00a0see it,\" he said. \"I think Republicans have to do a\u00a0much better job of putting that\u00a0on the line clearly and not starting\u00a0from a weak position when they negotiate with\u00a0Speaker Pelosi,\" the Fox News contributor concluded.

        "text": "Games\nFox News contributor Brian Brenberg breaks down what's inside the latest deal. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday said he was \"really unhappy\" with the stimulus package being negotiated in Congress, saying it was not acceptable that the deal was unlikely to include state and local aid. \"What do we see right now in Washington? Endless discussion that now is leaving out all state and local aid, that means that city government, state government will not be able to get back on our feet and serve our people -- it just doesn\u2019t make any sense,\" he said. TRUMP URGED TO VETO OMNIBUS SPENDING BILL; HOUSE REPUBLICANS\u00a0CALL\u00a0IT EXAMPLE OF 'SWAMP POLITICS' Negotiations are still underway for an approximately $900 billion coronavirus stimulus bill, separate from an omnibus spending bill to keep\u00a0the government open. Fox News is told the measure will likely lack a liability shield for lawsuits and money for state and local governments. However, there is an effort to tuck a provision in the bill for another round of direct payments.\u00a0 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday that \"We're still talking and I think we're gonna get there.\" On Thursday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: \"We're very close to an agreement, but the details really matter when it comes to unemployment benefits, stimulus checks, aid to small businesses and so much else.\" But\u00a0de Blasio\u00a0said\u00a0that sidelining local aid means there will be no proper recovery in places like New York.\u00a0\u00a0 \"I don\u2019t find this package acceptable, it\u2019s not going to get us where we need to go,\" although he said direct payments were a step in the right direction. New York City was the epicenter of the COVID crisis in the U.S., and has struggled to reopen its schools and businesses. Schools have partly re-opened but the already-limited indoor dining was shutdown this week amid rising numbers of infections and hospitalizations. De Blasio announced Thursday that the city currently has a 6 percent 7-day test positivity rate, and 2,739 positive or suspected cases of the virus. He has also warned about the potential for another lockdown in the Big Apple. Hizzoner said the federal government had obligations on issues like FEMA aid, school funding, transit funding due to the origins of the crisis. \"So really, really unhappy with what I see, but if they are going to do a deal, at least get it right on the things they\u2019re talking about now, and help us to keep going, but we\u2019re going to need a much bigger stimulus than this.\" Later, on the prospect of a second stimulus coming next year, he said it was unclear about chances of such an effort considering the political environment in Washington. He made reference to the two Georgia Senate runoff races that will determine which party controls the upper chamber next year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We don't know what\u2019s going to happen in elections in Georgia, we dont know what's going to happen in the Senate, we know that Mitch McConnell consistently has been standing in the way of aid to localities,\" he said. \"I'm very worried about that so I don't know when the next stimulus is, so I want to see this stimulus help us get back on our feet,\" he added.

        "text": "Games\nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., argues Senate Republicans who voted for the bill are \u2018no better than the Democrats,\u2019 calls on Americans to \u2018elect better people.\u2019 Just when you thought Washington couldn\u2019t possibly be more reckless and wasteful, it found a way. Late on Monday evening, Congress passed, with strong bipartisan support, a $900 billion coronavirus relief bill and $1.4 trillion spending bill, averting a looming government shutdown and extending coronavirus relief measures put into place in March under the CARES Act. The bills included a long list of disgustingly wasteful spending provisions, foreign aid and pet projects, including millions of dollars for monitoring climate change in Tibet, cash for investigating the 1908 Springfield Race Riot and $10 million for \"gender programs\" in Pakistan. Congress even agreed to spend $231 million to help Sudan pay down its national debt \u2014 a particularly ironic waste of taxpayer money, considering that the United States is now more than $27.5 trillion in the hole. (And, apparently, Congress isn\u2019t done digging.) TRUMP\u2019S CALL FOR $2,000 STIMULUS CHECKS HAILED \u2013 BY CRITICS PELOSI, AOC, SANDERS But while nearly everything in the bills ought to be heavily scrutinized, the one provision that deserves the most criticism is Congress\u2019s decision to send another round of stimulus checks to most Americans, including millions of people who have not lost their jobs as a result of the government lockdowns imposed to slow the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the provisions in the legislation, adults who earned less than $75,000 in 2019 would receive a $600 payment from the government. Couples who earned less than $150,000 would receive $1,200. Individuals who earned more than $75,000 and couples who earned more than $150,000 would receive lower amounts, until income reaches $87,000 for individuals and $174,000 for couples, at which point payments would be phased out completely. Sending people \"stimulus\" checks when government refuses to allow much of the economy to operate normally is not only a fool\u2019s errand, it\u2019s cronyism at its worst. Sending hundreds of billions of dollars to tens of millions of people who don\u2019t need it would be incredibly reckless under any economic conditions, but this provision, which is meant to \"stimulate\" the economy, is particularly outrageous considering that much of the U.S. economy is still closed, and some cities and states have recently made moves to further restrict economic activity. Sending people \"stimulus\" checks when government refuses to allow much of the economy to operate normally is not only a fool\u2019s errand, it\u2019s cronyism at its worst, as those who stand to benefit the most from the payments are massive corporations like Amazon, which has unquestionably been one of the pandemic\u2019s biggest winners. On Tuesday, President Trump called the legislation a \"disgrace\" and blasted Congress, including many in his own party, for agreeing to spend truckloads of cash on countless unnecessary projects, including many overseas, while American families and small businesses are suffering. FOR CORONAVIRUS RELIEF, TRUMP DEMANDS CONGRESS INCREASE DIRECT PAYMENTS TO AMERICANS But what seemed at first to be a brief moment of sanity quickly took a turn for the worse, when President Trump called on Congress to increase stimulus spending. \"I am asking Congress to amend this bill and increase the ridiculously low $600 to $2,000, or $4,000 for a couple,\" Trump said. The far-left wing of the Democratic Party, which has long been arguing for larger stimulus payments, immediately seized the moment, with socialist members of the \"Squad\" openly calling for Congress to adopt President Trump\u2019s proposal. \"Let\u2019s do it,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter. \"@RashidaTlaib and I already co-wrote the COVID amendment for $2,000 checks, so it\u2019s ready to go. Glad to see the President is willing to support our legislation. We can pass $2k checks this week if the Senate GOP agrees to stand down.\" Democratic Party leadership quickly signed on. \"I\u2019m in,\" wrote Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Twitter. \"Whaddya say, Mitch [McConnell]? Let\u2019s not get bogged down with ideological offsets and unrelated items and just DO THIS! The American people deserve it.\" Democrats are now working to secure a vote to increase stimulus payments by unanimous consent on the floor of the House on Christmas Eve day, putting Republicans in the terrible position of having to either torpedo the long-awaited relief bill at Christmas or agree to spend hundreds of billions more, further upsetting the party\u2019s conservative base. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER After everything we\u2019ve experienced in 2020, I guess nothing should surprise me, but I\u2019ve got to admit that I never thought I\u2019d see the day that President Trump would be helping socialists in Congress force Republican congressional leadership to agree to send thousands of dollars to millions of people who haven\u2019t lost their jobs. This episode is evidence that Washington is now totally devoid of any reason or common sense, never mind fiscal restraint. The president and Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, have so lost their way and slid into the abyss of modern monetary theory \u2014 an economic theory long advanced by the far left that insists debts and deficits don\u2019t matter \u2014 that it appears the country has been put on an irreversible course toward economic calamity. Governments can\u2019t print trillions upon trillions of dollars without causing inflation to skyrocket, crushing economic stagnation or both. It is a certainty that the entire country will soon have to grapple with, and when it does, the cost of returning to policies that have even a shred of fiscal sanity will be steep and painful. In Venezuela, similarly foolish money-printing policies led to inflation rates topping 65,000% \u00a0in 2018, laying waste to what used to be one of South America\u2019s wealthiest economies. In Japan, one of the world\u2019s most indebted nations, GDP has remained stagnant for more than two decades. In fact, the country\u2019s GDP in 2019 was lower than the country\u2019s total GDP in 1995. (Over the same period, U.S. GDP increased by nearly $14 trillion.) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Unfortunately, the United States appears to be on track to face a similar fate. Congress, now with the help of President Trump, is killing the American economy, the greatest engine of prosperity the world has ever known. And if we don\u2019t reverse course immediately, there will be no stopping the country\u2019s decline.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Georgia Democrats have reportedly already begun fuming over their two new senators, the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, who were\u00a0sworn in Wednesday by Vice President Kamala Harris, according to a new report. Both men narrowly won hard-fought races against Republican incumbents in the Peach State, winning control of the Senate for the Democrats in the process. But a major issue raised by critics is that President Biden espoused a coronavirus relief plan that would send $1,400 checks to many Americans \u2013 while Warnock and Ossoff campaigned on a $2,000 promise. BIDEN SPARKS BACKLASH AMONG SOME PROGRESSIVES OVER $1,400 STIMULUS CHECKS \"Warnock and Ossoff made it a point to endorse and exclusively say \u2018$2,000 checks,\u2019\" Georgia Democrat Oscar Zaro told Mediaite. \"A lot of the people in my district voted blue in the runoff for two main reasons. One: Loeffler and Perdue denying us relief during COVID while profiting millions themselves; and two, $2,000 checks.\" Leading into the Jan. 5 runoff elections were a series of campaign events espousing the $2,000 stimulus check proposal in the days after former President Trump signed a $600-check plan in late December. Then-President-elect Joe Biden stands on stage with Georgia Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate Raphael Warnock, right, and Jon Ossoff, left, in Atlanta, Monday, Jan. 4, 2021. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)  Senate Republicans blocked a $2,000 plan at the time even though it had Trump's support. \"If you send Jon and the reverend to Washington, those $2,000 checks will go out the door, restoring hope and decency for so many people who are struggling right now,\" Biden said at a rally for both candidates on Jan. 4. BIDEN WHITE HOUSE WEBSITE HIDES SECRET INVITATION FOR CODERS Reelecting GOP Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, on the other hand, would ensure \"those checks will never get there,\" he argued. Rogelio Linares, a Democratic canvasser during the runoff elections, told Mediaite that he feels \"like s---\" over the issue and called it \"a betrayal of the working class. \"I was lying to people that were relying on this,\" he said. \"At the time I didn\u2019t know it was a lie. But that was not the reality.\" LOEFFLER RIPS CANCEL CULTURE AND 'DANGEROUS NARRATIVES' IN FAREWELL ADDRESS Another Peach State voter, Justin Wade, told the outlet the $1,400 checks are \"a bad sign\" and noted that Democrats and supportive PACs had dumped record-breaking totals on campaign spending into the state in their effort to win the Senate -- only to immediately back away from the $2,000 total. In a slew of tweets and televised interviews, Ossoff brought up the $2,000 issue and attacked his opponent, Perdue, over the payouts. \" If David Perdue really wanted $2000 direct relief checks for the people, he'd be on the floor of the Senate demanding McConnell put up the House bill for a vote,\" Ossoff tweeted at one point. The $2,000 check issue became so prominent in the Georgia races that even the Republican candidates endorsed the call for bigger checks. But now Biden is supporting a $1,400 plan. On top of December\u2019s $600 checks, the total adds up to $2,000 \u2013 but critics say the campaign messaging was clear. It called for $2,000 checks. Progressives from other states, including \"Squad\" Reps. Alexandia Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Cori Bush, have also criticized the $1,400 move. A Fox News Voter Analysis conducted on the runoff elections also found that 43% of Georgia voters viewed the coronavirus pandemic as the country\u2019s most important issue, and 72% said they felt Congress had done too little about it to help individual Americans. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Due to the wins by Ossoff and Warnock, Democrats and the two independent senators who caucus with them have a 50-50 split in the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris representing a tie-breaking vote. And though moderate Democratic West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said he would \"absolutely not\" vote for $2,000 checks, it could still pass with minor Republican support. Spokespeople for Warnock and Ossoff did not immediately respond to Fox News' requests for comment.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Congressional Democrats' complaints about the expiration of federal unemployment assistance are\u00a0entirely political,\u00a0former George W. Bush speechwriter and Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen has charged. Writing in The\u00a0Washington Post, Thiessen noted that five out of six recipients of the\u00a0$600 federal benefit,\u00a0which expired last\u00a0week, made\u00a0more money sitting at home than while working. \"The federal supplement did not affect employment during the lockdown, because the economy was shut down and there were no jobs available,\" Theissen said. \"But now that businesses are reopening, employers trying to rehire workers are\u00a0finding\u00a0that they can\u2019t\u00a0compete\u00a0with enhanced unemployment.\" NYC'S DEBLASIO APPEARS TO BLAME CRIME SURGE ON LACK OF FEDERAL STIMULUS When it comes to the current impasse over a\u00a0\"Phase 4\" coronavirus stimulus,\u00a0Thiessen argued, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., understand that the longer the economy suffers, the greater the potential political windfall in November. \"Pelosi has no incentive to negotiate,\" he wrote.\u00a0\"If Republicans capitulate, Democrats win \u2014 because the $600 supplement will slow the recovery while they get credit for forcing the GOP to give unemployed Americans a massive cash infusion. MCCONNELL OPEN TO EXTENDING $600 UNEMPLOYMENT BOOST IN CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS DEAL \"And if Republicans don\u2019t cave, Democrats also win \u2014 because people lose their benefits, the recovery craters and Republicans get the blame. The only scenario in which Democrats think they lose is compromise \u2014 because they would have to share credit with Trump for doing the right thing.\" Thiessen wrote that\u00a0outside of Congress,\u00a0liberals are willing to work with conservatives to craft proposals that both help the unemployed and prevent those who are without a job from willfully refusing to work to collect a government check. Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner\u00a0has created a \"bipartisan plan\" that would tie the federal unemployment supplement to each state's respective unemployment rate and a worker's last recorded earnings. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The supplement would be capped at $400 a week ...\u00a0In states that cannot calculate previous earnings, the supplement would be capped at $200. It would be eliminated once a state\u2019s unemployment rate drops to about 7 percent,\" Thiessen explained. \"This is perfectly reasonable proposal. And it shows that when politics are removed from the equation, it is possible to reach a bipartisan compromise. But Democrats don\u2019t want a bipartisan compromise. They are insisting on extending the $600 a month until January with no changes and have refused to even pass a temporary extension of the program while the two sides negotiate.\" Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., does not share the enthusiasm Democratic leaders showed toward\u00a0the coronavirus stimulus bill that the Senate passed this week after extensive negotiations, claiming that the provision that will send money\u00a0to individuals does not go far enough. According to the bill, nonresident aliens are not eligible for the payments, which are generally $1,200 for those who file taxes as individuals and $2,400 for those who file jointly. AOC ALLY PANS 'RIDICULOUS' PELOSI CLAIM ON CLIMATE CHANGE MEASURE IN CORONAVIRUS BILL \"To clarify, $1200 checks are ONLY going to some w/social sec numbers, NOT immigrants w/ tax IDs (ITINs),\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \"Thanks to GOP, these checks will be cut off the backs of *taxpaying immigrants,* who get nothing. Many are essential workers who pay more taxes than Amazon.

PELOSI HINTS AT WHAT DEMS COULD INCLUDE IN NEXT CORONAVIRUS BILL Despite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praising Senate Democrats for using their \"leverage\" to obtain the party's goals with the bill, Ocasio-Cortez blamed Republicans and the Trump administration for holding those in need \"hostage\" to secure benefits for corporations. \"What Trump + Senate GOP have done is hold hospitals, working people, and the vulnerable hostage so they could get in $500 billion (that will be leveraged into $4T) in corporate welfare,\" she said. \"Without the Wall St giveaway, GOP refuses to fund hospitals & unemployment.

        "text": "Games\nFOX News congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest developments on 'FOX News Live' White House\u00a0communications director Kate Bedingfield remained confident Sunday that President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill narrowly passed by the Senate over the weekend would ultimately reach the president's\u00a0desk, as the legislation is up for a vote in the House this week where Democrats hold a narrow majority. In an appearance on CNN's \"State of Union,\" Bedingfield described the bill -- called American Rescue Plan \u2013 as a \"historic and transformational piece of legislation\" that will \"cut child poverty in half\" by making investments in the child tax credit, fund a vaccine program and get money out to schools to reopen, even with the nation strapped with $28 trillion in debt. BIDEN GIVES PREMATURE PAT ON THE BACK TO DEMOCRATS ON COVID BILL, IGNORES PROGRESSIVES \"This is an incredibly transformational, frankly progressive piece of legislation,\" Bedingfield told CNN host Jake Tapper, who questioned whether the bill has enough votes in the House to pass.\u00a0 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., can only afford to lose four votes and still send the bill to Biden's desk for his first major legislative win. Progressives in the House have raised concerns about changes to the bill that eliminate the $15 minimum federal wage, lower weekly unemployment benefits from $400 to $300, and limit income eligibility for stimulus checks. \"You heard Sen. [Bernie] Sanders say that this was the best legislation for working people in the modern history of this country,\" Bedingfield said. \"This is a bill that reflects President Biden's belief that the best way to get the economy back on track and get it growing is to invest in working people and middle-class people.\" Acknowledging support from Sanders, Tapper pointed out that other progressive Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., both have voiced criticism of the legislation. BERNIE SANDERS AMENDMENT FOR $15 MINIMUM WAGE FAILS IN SENATE IN LONGEST VOTE IN HISTORY And the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the bill's move to raise\u00a0the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour would violate budget rules. Some Republicans said they would support amending the federal minimum wage to\u00a0$10 an hour, and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said he supported an $11 an hour change to the bill. Despite claiming Biden is willing to work with Republicans,\u00a0Bedingfield said that the president supports a\u00a0$15 an hour hike.\u00a0 \"President Biden supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour,\" Bedingfield said. \"That is where he stands. That is where he stood for a long time. He believes strongly that people who are in this country who are working full time can make a living wage and not be living in poverty.\" \"The conversation is going to turn to how we tackle the minimum wage,\" she continued. \"The president is looking forward to working with Congress to determine the best way to do it. What I can say to you right now is the president is committed to raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.\" Biden cheered the passage Saturday, brushing off the lack of any GOP support in the Senate or House, and said he hasn't given up on working with Republicans on future legislation. Biden touted the relief provisions in the bill, including unemployment benefits, food aid, vaccination distribution support and the $1,400 stimulus payments. He told Americans they'd be seeing those checks soon. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bedingfield reiterated Sunday that Biden\u2019s preference is not to end the filibuster, saying the administration would need to navigate through a 50-50 Senate. She said that although the bill was passed without any Republican support in the Senate, it did receive 75% approval from the American people \"including over 50% of Republicans\" who rallied behind Biden\u2019s approach. \"We were able to pass this legislation with massive bipartisan support across the country,\" she said.

Here is a breakdown for who should expect a check, as well as how and when they're going to get it. Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0\u00a0Sign up here. A company in Austin, Texas is looking to dock pay from workers who receive government stimulus checks, according to an anonymous employee.  With the historic $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus deal signed, Americans can look forward to receiving some economic relief during the pandemic.  CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE An unnamed company in Texas, though, appears to be looking to use the stimulus to relieve their payroll strain.  On Wednesday, the company sent out a form titled \u201cEmployee Acknowledgement of \u2018Government Assistance\u2019 Pay Reduction.\u201d  The form was reported by an employee who wished to remain anonymous, but the employee spoke to local news KXAN about the situation. TRUMP SIGNS $2T STIMULUS BILL AFTER HOUSE APPROVES HISTORIC CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE \u201cThe form says they are preemptively deducting funds from our paychecks. That number is based on what they\u2019re anticipating the government relief fund to be,\u201d the worker told the outlet. \u201cThe company that I work for is a national company and they make hundreds of millions of dollars in profit a year and instead of making sacrifices at the higher levels, they\u2019re passing it on down to everybody else.\u201d DO YOU QUALIFY FOR A STIMULUS CHECK IN SENATE'S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL? The form states that the company would take payment from the employee\u2019s paycheck by 100 percent\u00a0of any money received under the stimulus bill, a number they can accurately calculate since the stimulus money is scaled based on income.  Other companies may or may not also attempt to take advantage of the stimulus money.  'PERFECTLY HEALTHY' TEXAS DAD WITH CORONAVIRUS DIES FROM COVID-19 On the blog AskAManager.org, another anonymous employee wrote in to ask if it is legal for her company to take the stimulus money from their paychecks. She states that she learned of the decision during a conference call.  She claimed her company is a national restaurant chain. The company she works for may or may not be the same as the one in Austin.

        "text": "Games\n\u2018The Five\u2019 react to the fact-checking website Snopes admitting that President Biden wore a hard hat backward after flagging it as false, and 'SNL' mocking Trump for allegedly making up \u2018de-bank,\u2019 a real term. Liberal fact-checker Snopes had egg on its face over its attempt at running cover for President Biden.\u00a0 Biden went viral last week for wearing a construction hard hat backwards during a photo op with Wisconsin union workers. But as critics mocked the president on social media, Snopes published an article declaring the claim he wore it backwards was \"false.\" \"The photo is genuine. And it does look, at first glance, like Biden was wearing that hard hat backwards,\" Snopes told readers. \"But after comparing it to other photos and videos of the same event, we were forced to reach the opposite conclusion: The hat on Biden's head was facing forward, bill to the front, not backward.\" SOCIAL MEDIA STUNNED AFTER SNOPES FACT-CHECK REVERSAL ON PRESIDENT BIDEN'S BACKWARDS HARDHAT Snopes was forced to issue a correction after critics blasted its fact-check claiming President Biden was wearing his hard hat correctly.\u00a0 (Snopes, X: Amy Klobuchar) Bizarrely included in Snopes' report was another photo from Biden's visit showing a union worker wearing the same hard hat the correct way but suggested it was being worn backwards.\u00a0 \"Anyone want to razz that man for how he chooses to wear his hard hat?\" Snopes asked.\u00a0 Well, critics razzed Snopes instead, so much so that the fact-checker was forced to issue a correction.\u00a0 \"We received a ton of comments in a very short time challenging our assumption that wearing a hard hat \u2018backwards\u2019 means wearing it with the bill facing to the rear, and \u2018forwards\u2019 means wearing it bill to the front,\" Snopes wrote in a long-winded editor's note before concluding that the viral claim about Biden was in fact true.\u00a0 The hard hat debacle is hardly the only example of Snopes getting its facts wrong. Last year, for example, Snopes suggested the viral claim that X owner Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink company was partially responsible for the disappearance of the OceanGate submersible was \"true,\" then updated the fact check to say it was \"unproven,\" before finally adding the necessary context and deeming the allegation \"false.\"\u00a0 And in 2022, Snopes was scolded by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 office for claiming a realistic-looking list of banned books circulating on social media \"originated as satire\" rather than simply being declared \"false,\" despite including titles such as \"The Lord of the Rings.\"\u00a0 When it comes to fact-checkers botching their own fact-checks, Snopes is in good company.\u00a0 Like Snopes, USA Today published a specious fact-check in defense of Biden, who in September 2021 was accused of repeatedly looking at his watch during a dignified transfer ceremony honoring the 13 US servicemen killed in the Kabul airport terrorist attack during the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.\u00a0 USA TODAY ISSUES CORRECTION ON \u2018FACT CHECK\u2019 AFTER CLAIMING BIDEN CHECKED WATCH \u2018ONLY AFTER CEREMONY\u2019 AT DOVER After Gold Star families aired their complaints against the president, USA Today insisted Biden checked his watch \"only after the ceremony,\" giving the claim a \"partly false\" rating. Following intense backlash, however, USA Today walked back its rating and conceded Biden \"checked his watch multiple times\" during the ceremony. But instead of giving the claim a \"true\" rating, USA Today inexplicably labeled the claim \"missing context.\" A fact-check from USA Today was panned for falsely claiming President Biden didn't check his watch during the dignified transfer ceremony in September 2021 following the Kabul airport terrorist attack.\u00a0 (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) In 2022, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler offered a mea culpa for a 2021 fact-check that handed two Pinocchios to Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., for predicting that murderers like convicted terrorist Dzhokhar Tsarnaev would receive a COVID stimulus check. \u00a0 At the time, Kessler dismissed Cotton's assertion as a \"hyped-up claim\" that \"lack[ed] significant context,\" dismissing his comments as \"scaremogering.\" However, records later revealed Tsarnaev, who is currently serving a life sentence after murdering three people and injuring hundreds of others in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, had received over $21,000 since his time as an inmate and among the deposits was COVID relief in June 2021. Kessler was forced to revisit his poorly-aged fact-check after receiving an email from Cotton's press secretary requesting an update to the 2021 article.\u00a0 WAPO FACT-CHECKER BACKTRACKS AFTER COTTON CORRECTLY PREDICTED BOSTON BOMBER WOULD RECEIVE COVID STIMULUS CHECK \"We take such requests seriously and are always willing to review a fact check in light of new information,\" Kessler wrote in an \"update\" of his report. \"Cotton primarily received the Two-Pinocchio rating because his comments lacked context\u2026 Still, Cotton\u2019s predictive powers should be acknowledged. He said the Boston bomber would get a stimulus check \u2014 and Tsarnaev did.\" \"But in retrospect, the use of the phrase of \u2018scaremongering\u2019 was inappropriate. Cotton had raised a legitimate issue of concern, even if he framed it in a political way. The term \u2018hyped up\u2019 in the headline went too far as well,\" Kessler admitted. \"Thus, we will reduce the rating on this claim to One Pinocchio \u2014 our version of 'mostly true.' His statement still lacks some context, but he was certainly correct that Tsarnaev would receive a stimulus check.\" The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. (Washington Post/FOX) In November 2021, PolitiFact doubled down on an erroneous fact-check from 2020 claiming Kyle Rittenhouse's possession of a weapon during the Kenosha riots wasn't legal, despite the judge overseeing the murder trial tossing out a charge against him of having a dangerous weapon as a minor.\u00a0 The outlet originally challenged a claim made by a random Facebook user in August 2020 who wrote, \"Carrying a rifle across state lines is perfectly legal,\" adding, \"Based on the laws I can find of this area at 17 years old Kyle was perfectly legal to be able to possess that rifle without parental supervision.\" \"Is that true? State laws suggest not,\" PolitiFact's\u00a0Daniel\u00a0Funke wrote at the time. \"The Wisconsin Department of Justice honors concealed carry permits issued in Illinois. But Rittenhouse did not have a permit to begin with, and he was not legally old enough to carry a firearm in Wisconsin,\" Funke wrote, before going into concealed and open carry laws in Wisconsin and Rittenhouse's home state of Illinois. POLITIFACT ROASTED FOR PREVIOUS 'FACT-CHECK' CLAIMING KYLE RITTENHOUSE'S POSSESSION OF WEAPON WASN'T LEGAL Funke did cite a Wisconsin gun rights attorney who noted an exception to shotguns and rifles, which allows \"children ages 16 and 17\" to hunt, but said it doesn't apply to Rittenhouse because he \"wasn\u2019t in Kenosha to hunt.\" \"Whether Rittenhouse violated Wisconsin law by possessing a firearm underage is the subject of ongoing litigation. But the Facebook post claimed that it was \u2018perfectly legal\u2019 for the teenager to carry an assault-style rifle in Kenosha,\" Funke continued. \"At best, that\u2019s unproven. At worst, it\u2019s inaccurate. Either way, we rate the post False.\" After the fact-check resurfaced during the Rittenhouse trial when the gun charge was dismissed, PolitiFact updated its report with a lengthy editor's note, which concluded, \"These subsequent events show the grey areas of local gun laws \u2014 hardly a case of something being \u2018perfectly legal.\u2019 Our fact-check remains unchanged.\"\u00a0 Notably, Funke was the same \"fact-checker\" behind USA Today's Biden fact-check. He is now an editor at Agence France-Presse (AFP) News Agency.\u00a0 PolitiFact doubled down on its poorly-aged fact-check insisting Kyle Rittenhouse's possession of a weapon was illegal despite being proven otherwise in court.\u00a0 (Sean Krajacic/Pool via REUTERS) CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale co-authored a \"Facts First\" report in March 2020 challenging a litany of alleged COVID-related falsehoods made by then-President Trump and his administration. Among them was Trump's assertion that a vaccine would come \"relatively soon.\" \u2018Relatively soon\u2019 is too vague a phrase to call this claim false, but Trump did not mention that Fauci had told him earlier that day that a vaccine was \u2018a year to a year and a half\u2019 away. Fauci similarly told the Senate the next day that the process of getting a vaccine ready to deploy \u2018will take at least a year and a year and a half,\u2019\" Dale wrote at the time.\u00a0 Of course, the COVID vaccines came much sooner than a year and a half as companies like Pfizer and Moderna announced they had developed their own vaccines just eight months later.\u00a0 CNN FACT-CHECKER DANIEL DALE MOCKED FOR TIMID CRITIQUE OF BIDEN'S HABIT OF 'INVENTING AND EMBELLISHING STORIES CNN's Daniel Dale has fact-checked Donald Trump far more than Joe Biden since the latter took office. (Screenshot/CNN) Perhaps the biggest failure to come from the fact-checkers was when they collectively dismissed the COVID lab leak theory in 2020. In the early months of the pandemic, several prominent Republicans, including Cotton, suggested COVID leaked from China's Wuhan Institute of Virology instead of stemming from a natural origin like the often-cited wet markets. It wasn't until more recently that multiple government agencies, including the FBI have publicly concluded that COVID \"most likely\" came from the lab. At the time, however, Cotton and others were hit with an onslaught of fact-checks rejecting the lab leak theory. USA Today confidently stated in its fact-check that the lab leak theory was \"false information\" that was pushed by right-leaning outlets, calling it a \"conspiracy\" and giving it a \"FALSE\" rating.\u00a0 CREDIBILITY CRISIS: MEDIA \u2018FACT-CHECKERS\u2019 WERE EAGER TO DEBUNK COVID LAB LEAK THEORY, HAD TO ISSUE CORRECTIONS\u00a0 Snopes similarly declared in April 2020 that the infectiousness of COVID \"is a testament to natural selection, not bioengineering\" and that any notion that it originated from a lab was a \"conspiracy theory.\"\u00a0 In March 2021, a separate fact-check from Snopes took a swipe at Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who implied that COVID came from a lab, writing, \"Repeating something countless times over the course of a year does not actually make it a fact.\"\u00a0 CNN published a \"Facts First\" examination of Cotton's claims in February 2020, insisting \"it\u2019s possible, yet unlikely, that the lab was connected to the start of the outbreak.\"\u00a0 A separate CNN headline from April 2020 read \"Nearly 30% in the US believe a coronavirus theory that\u2019s almost certainly not true\" and was based on a Pew Research poll taken at the time.\u00a0 \"Its origin is up for debate, but it wasn\u2019t made in a lab,\" CNN reported. \"There\u2019s still much we don\u2019t know about the coronavirus pandemic, but virus experts agree on one piece of its origin story: The virus likely originated in a bat, not in a Chinese lab.\" Fact-checkers from CNN, Washington Post, USA Today, PolitiFact, Vox and Snopes all rushed to declare the COVID lab leak theory was false.\u00a0 (Hector Retamal/AFP via Getty Images) Liberal outlet Vox delved into the fact-checking game in April 2020 when it published a report, titled \"Why these scientists still doubt the coronavirus leaked from a Chinese lab.\" The article criticized the Trump administration for seeking \"new ways to blame China for the pandemic\" to \"divert attention from his failures\" and implied the \"spy-novel-worthy\" lab leak theory simply wasn\u2019t logical.\u00a0 \"Five scientists I interviewed, some of whom have worked extensively in China with researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, say the pandemic can\u2019t logically be pinned on an accident at that lab,\" Vox's then-science, health and climate editor Eliza Barclay \u2013 now the climate editor for New York Times Opinion \u2013 wrote in 2020. \"And one expert\u00a0added that it could be dangerous to get too preoccupied with this theory when the threat of another disease with pandemic potential from wildlife is so high.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Washington Post released a 10-minute video report tackling the subject concluding it was \"doubtful\" the virus came from a lab.\u00a0 \"The balance of scientific evidence strongly suggests the conclusion of the new coronavirus emerged from nature, be it in the Wuhan market or somewhere else,\" The Post fact-checker said. \"Too many perfect coincidences would have had to take place for it to have escaped from a lab, but the Chinese government has not been willing or able to provide information that would clarify lingering questions about any possible role played by the Wuhan labs.\" PolitiFact had one of the most alarming \"fact checks\" on Sept. 16, 2020, calling the lab leak possibility a \"debunked conspiracy theory\" that was \"inaccurate and ridiculous,\" handing it a \"Pants on Fire\" ruling.\u00a0 USA Today, Vox, PolitiFact and The Washington Post would ultimately revise their reporting, while CNN and Snopes chose not to update their erroneous articles.

A second company planned to dock coronavirus relief money from its workers\u2019 paychecks, but has since rescinded the plan, Fox News has learned. Over the weekend, Fox News reported that a Texas-based company planned to pre-emptively take money from its workers equivalent to what each employee might receive from the government\u2019s $2 trillion stimulus bill. CLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE The story sparked a strong backlash, and\u00a0companies that planned to take similar measures have started to rethink their strategy. As originally reported by the Lost Ogle, Oklahoma City-based company ImageNet Consulting intended to take this measure with its employees. As of Monday, the company issued a statement declaring that it will not follow through on that plan. TEXAS COMPANY LOOKING TO DOCK STIMULUS MONEY FROM PAYCHECKS ImageNet sent the following statement to Fox News:\u00a0\u201cAs our company grapples with the massive business disruptions caused by this outbreak, our first concern was ensuring we could keep as many people as possible employed for as long as possible. We implemented a series of steps to cut costs, including asking our top executives to forego their pay and capping all salaries at $75,000,\u201d said Pat Russell, president of ImageNet Consulting. \u201cWhile there was uncertainty about the federal government response, we also asked a small group of employees to reduce their compensation by an amount equal to any government support they received.\u201d TRUMP SIGNS $2T STIMULUS BILL AFTER HOUSE APPROVES HISTORIC CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE \u201cOur intentions were to serve the greater good and protect our most vulnerable employees. However, we understand our plan was ill-advised. We have rescinded the potential program, and we apologize for any pain or confusion it caused.\u201d The stimulus bill, signed by President Trump on Saturday, seeks to alleviate the mounting financial pressure. Individuals making $75,000 or less would receive $1,200, with an additional $500 per dependent. DO YOU QUALIFY FOR A STIMULUS CHECK IN SENATE'S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE BILL? Following lockdown orders by various states in response to the coronavirus pandemic, many Americans have either lost their jobs or have seen their hours reduced, with 3.28 million Americans claiming unemployment last week alone. While ImageNet does maintain Texas offices, with locations in Austin, Dallas, Houston and League City, the company that first sparked outrage with this plan was unnamed by the whistleblower.

Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo. joined the\u00a0\"Fox News Rundown\"\u00a0podcast Friday\u00a0to discuss life under quarantine\u00a0and plans by the White House and lawmakers to send\u00a0Americans\u00a0coronavirus relief checks. \"Look, this is different than 10 years ago when you had bad actors doing bad things asking for a bailout,\" Gardner told host Dave Anthony. This is a virus that came out of the blue, out of China, and here we are today dealing with it.\u00a0 It's not a Democrat or Republican or a business creation ... Thank\u00a0goodness our economy is as strong today as it was going into this, because we're going to need every ounce of that strength once we get out of this. \" SUBSCRIBE AND DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS RUNDOWN On Thursday,\u00a0Senate Majority Leader\u00a0Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., released his proposal for a massive stimulus package\u00a0to provide relief for struggling Americans, including payments of up to $1,200 per person and up to $2,400 for couples. MCCONNELL'S CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS PLAN WOULD PROVIDE PAYMENTS OF $1,200 PER PERSON, $2,400 FOR COUPLES The legislation is not a done deal as McConnell will still need to get Democrats -- and a few lingering Republicans -- on board. Negotiations are expected to run into the weekend, with\u00a0House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer saying McConnell's bill \"is not at all pro-worker and instead puts corporations way ahead of workers.\" Gardner emphasized Friday that an agreement among lawmakers on how much to send Americans had to be done quickly:\u00a0\"It can't take six months. It can't take a year. It's gotta happen soon. We do need to have immediate relief.\" READ MCCONNELL'S STIMULUS PROPOSAL When asked for his thoughts on the idea of sending a check to every American, Gardner told Anthony: \"I had suggested early on that we work through the unemployment insurance process to create a new category of workers that wouldn't require them to be laid off, it would not require them to be fired, but it\u00a0would be a way to get assistance through an existing mechanism quickly.\" \"A thousand dollars in Manhattan is different than a thousand dollars in Burlington, Colo.,\" Gardner noted, explaining why he thought\u00a0\"going through an existing scalable mechanism like unemployment insurance would be a better approach because you could take those kinds of anomalies into account when you did the funding for it.\" MNUCHIN SAYS WH LOOKING TO SEND $1,000 CHECKS TO MOST AMERICANS WITHIN 3 WEEKS\u00a0 Gardner phoned into the podcast while under self- quarantine after coming\u00a0into direct contact with a constituent who later tested positive for the coronavirus, he explained. \"I had a meeting with a constituent in my office that had not been showing symptoms while he was in the office. And it was a personal meeting ... in my official office. That was of sufficient concern to them that they said, 'You need to be quarantined,'\" Gardner said. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo.\u00a0is also under self-quarantine\u00a0after a meeting with someone who\u00a0Gardner assumed to be\u00a0the same infected constituent. \"He's [Crow's] back home in Colorado.

Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox.\u00a0\u00a0Sign up here. The United States has overcome every challenge we have ever faced. The coronavirus pandemic will be no exception. Yet while the American people have risen to the needs of the moment, in some vital ways our political class has fallen short.\u00a0They have done too much to help some who\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0need it, and too little to help some who need it most. During a national crisis, extraordinary measures are not only reasonable, but they are also required. In recent months, the federal government has boosted unemployment insurance to directly help those who suddenly and unexpectedly lost jobs, created a forgivable loan program for small businesses that were forced into lockdown, and pushed critical funds into the health care system\u00a0\u2013\u00a0the front lines of the fight against the virus. These wise moves have saved lives and livelihoods. Unfortunately, they have been mixed with unwise ones. REP. WARREN DAVIDSON: CORONAVIRUS RELIEF\u00a0\u2014 MAKE CONGRESS WORK AGAIN BEFORE MORE DEALS APPROVED Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the largest government stimulus measure in American history, at a cost of roughly $2 trillion. The biggest chunk of money was up to $500 billion that can be used for bailouts for large corporations, many of which have access to private capital, and their shareholders.\u00a0This is the opposite of the broad-based relief to individuals and small businesses that\u2019s most needed. The pandemic struck everyone. When government singles out industries, it injects political favoritism into a process that must avoid it. Moreover, these bailouts turn America\u2019s economic system on its head.\u00a0Large corporations are typically financed and governed by sophisticated investors. Those investors rightly benefit from corporate profits in prosperous times; they should bear the losses when times are tough. It is fundamentally unjust to pass that burden to ordinary taxpayers who are themselves struggling. We cannot have a system where corporate gains are\u00a0private\u00a0and losses are socialized. Beyond the bailouts, the CARES Act too often failed to tailor relief to the most urgent problems. It included multibillion-dollar handouts to states, hospitals and universities regardless of how the virus affected them.\u00a0Hospitals with large COVID-19 caseloads at times got less per patient than facilities with few cases.\u00a0Wealthy universities with multibillion-dollar endowments got funding.\u00a0Even the sensible unemployment benefit expansion went too far, with many now being paid more than when they were working. Similarly, the well-intended small-business loan program ended up benefiting some 300 Wall Street-traded companies and many others that didn\u2019t require help.\u00a0That explains why the initial $349 billion in this program ran out in only 13 days, forcing Congress to refill it with an additional $310 billion.\u00a0The billions that went to companies that didn\u2019t need it left less for suffering small businesses and their workers. Like many states, Illinois has a pandemic of irresponsible government.\u00a0That\u2019s one disease Congress must not try to cure with a bailout.\u00a0 Yet maybe the greatest lesson from Congress\u2019 coronavirus response is that massive blunders are inevitable when government spends this much money this fast.\u00a0It is impossible to wisely spend nearly $3 trillion in two months. There\u2019s no question that this is\u00a0an emergency situation\u00a0that required huge spending.\u00a0But it should not escape our attention that the federal deficit is now expected to reach nearly $4 trillion this year alone, pushing the national debt well over $25 trillion. This unprecedented burden will force painful decisions on future generations who will not have the comfort of knowing that it was all well spent. Some lawmakers are now calling for hundreds of billions, if not trillions, more.\u00a0On what?\u00a0They want bailouts for states that have mismanaged their finances for decades. While the pandemic has caused a short-term decline in state revenue that can legitimately be addressed, some states were already facing massive shortfalls well before the coronavirus. Illinois, for example, is asking for $10 billion to bail out a pension system that state politicians have chronically underfunded. Like many states, Illinois has a pandemic of irresponsible government.\u00a0That\u2019s one disease Congress must not try to cure with a bailout. Finally, a chorus of socialist voices is claiming this crisis shows the failures of capitalism and the need for a government takeover of huge sections of the economy. Really? The single best thing the Trump administration has done to address the crisis is clear away the regulatory hurdles for private research companies, scientists and the medical community to create the health care innovations that will bring America through this. As for the economy\u00a0\u2013\u00a0bigger, bossier, more bloated government will only get in the way and make a much-needed recovery harder and slower.\u00a0We\u2019re already seeing the favoritism, waste and unintended consequences that come when Congress quickly spends $3 trillion. Imagine the damage the socialists\u2019 $30 trillion would do. CLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER Our biggest challenges are clear.\u00a0They are mass unemployment, a shuttered economy that is crippling the small businesses that provide half of all jobs, and a virus that we still don\u2019t fully have a medical handle on.\u00a0We can address these challenges with direct payments to laid-off workers and struggling small businesses, and a massive infusion of private sector and scientific talent brought to bear on our urgent medical needs. The cost of such efforts is worth it.\u00a0Much more, and the price will be more than present and future generations of Americans can bear.

        "text": "Games\nAdoptive parents Geffrey and Stefani Thompson share their story alongside Selfless Love Foundation\u2019s Ashley Brown to celebrate National Adoption Month I will never forget the pitter-patter of the\u00a0tiny\u00a0feet on the cold,\u00a0tile\u00a0floor, tottering to my wife and\u00a0me\u00a0from around the corner,\u00a0as we eagerly awaited meeting our three-year-old son for the very first time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our emotions surged: excitement, nervousness, gratitude, disbelief, joy. \u00a0\u00a0 I also felt a tinge of sadness \u2013 and even guilt \u2013 knowing that we could have easily missed out on this most precious moment if it weren\u2019t for the resolve of my incredible wife, Sarah, and\u00a0the\u00a0words a priest had shared at a retreat two years prior: \"What is going to be the thing in your life that defines you, your \u2018yes?\u2019\" \u00a0\u00a0 ADOPTIVE MOTHER SHARES COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT FOSTERING AND ADOPTION For years, Sarah had expressed to me a special, persistent longing of her heart to adopt one of the thousands of children overseas who were orphaned simply because they had an extra chromosome in their DNA. \u00a0\u00a0 Unfortunately, at\u00a0first,\u00a0I resisted this beautiful idea. \u00a0\u00a0 We already had five incredible children, whom we loved with all our hearts. And growing up in the 80s and 90s -- where the culture emphasized having \"healthy\" children and a \"perfect\" family -- I felt\u00a0unprepared\u00a0to embrace the responsibilities of adoption, much less the adoption of a child with a so-called \u2018disability.\u2019 \u00a0\u00a0 The Effhauser family  Today, I know my mindset at the time was deeply flawed. The truth is that I was letting my fear overcome me.\u00a0 Sarah\u2019s bravery helped me to find my own. Shortly after having our fifth child, she asked me to intentionally pray and reflect upon her unceasing desire to embrace a child in need. \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0While\u00a0I was away at a men\u2019s prayer retreat, the question inviting me to choose my \"yes\" resonated over and over, filling me with the certainty that I had previously lacked. \u00a0\u00a0 We met our son, Rex\u00a0Stefan, on Valentine\u2019s Day. To say he stole our hearts would be a vast understatement. In fact, he mended them in ways we\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0know possible.\u00a0\u00a0 Learning that I was all-in, Sarah resigned from her job, and we prepared for the adoption process \u2013 a long, tedious, and expensive endeavor that required immense planning and flexibility. Soon after, the pandemic struck, and we worked hard to\u00a0maintain\u00a0the funds needed for eligibility and next steps. \u00a0\u00a0 ADOPTED AS A CHILD, TEXAS WOMAN IS NOW HELPING OTHERS FIND HOPE AND FEEL LOVED AT CHRISTMAS\u00a0 However, we quickly discovered we were not alone. The community flocked to us with support, encouragement, and\u00a0assistance. Our confidence was reinforced as hurdle after hurdle dissolved in front of our eyes. \u00a0\u00a0 Grants and gifts came flooding in, as well as handfuls of stimulus checks that friends and family did not want or need. To top it off, we also received an email from Bree\u2019s Gift, a beautiful adoption foundation named\u00a0in memory of\u00a0Bree Johnley, which pledged to cover the rest of our dues. \u00a0\u00a0 Matt and Sarah Effhauser with Rex Stefan in Belgrade  Fueling us \u2013 and our community \u2013 was the picture of a sweet baby boy in Serbia with the most innocent, glossy brown eyes, and the biggest, happiest smile. We knew upon the first glance that he was our son. \u00a0\u00a0 The wait was long and grueling; but finally, after over a year, we were granted permission to come to Serbia and bring our son home. \u00a0 Res Stefan Effhauser  We met our son, Rex\u00a0Stefan, on Valentine\u2019s Day. To say he stole our hearts would be a vast understatement. In fact, he mended them in ways we\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0know possible.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This was the very child that God had\u00a0set\u00a0aside\u00a0for us to mend a broken bond, the child who we would spend the rest of our lives loving and caring for.\u00a0 CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION How beautiful it was to be with him as he, wide-eyed, experienced many of his \"firsts:\" riding in a car, going for a walk\u00a0down busy city streets, trying new foods, and meeting his siblings, who surprised him in the airport upon arriving back at home. \u00a0\u00a0 This was the very child that God had\u00a0set\u00a0aside\u00a0for us to mend a broken bond, the child who we would spend the rest of our lives loving and caring for.\u00a0 Rex\u00a0completes our family. It feels as if he has always been there, just another one of our incredible children who adds such light to our home. He has made our \u2018perfect\u2019 family more perfect than we could ever have imagined. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This November adoption month, we feel compelled to share how our family needs Rex \u2013 our five biological children, my wife, and especially me. Our community needs him, too \u2013 like our church members, who love him dearly; and our\u00a0community schools, where hundreds of students know him by name and cheer him on. \u00a0\u00a0 It is devastating to think that here in America, and especially in places like\u00a0Eastern\u00a0Europe, children are tragically aborted every day because of a potential Down Syndrome diagnosis. Parents are led to believe that \"hard\" equates to \"bad,\" and these lies prevent beautiful daughters, sons, siblings, and friends from entering the world. \u00a0\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Children like Rex are so much more than the\u00a0very small\u00a0part of them that is considered a \u2018disability.\u2019 Their joy, humor, lovingness, energetic spirit, and dignity as human beings are what define them, not a label. They, like every other child, deserve boundless love.\u00a0\u00a0 Today, Rex is a thriving five-year-old. Yet,\u00a0less than\u00a0two years in with our son, we\u00a0can confidently say that the beauty of adoption will be our best \u2018yes\u2019 of all time.\u00a0 Matt Effhauser resides in\u00a0East Grand Forks, Minn.,,\u00a0with his loving wife, Sarah, and their six children.
