TODO:
- use the datasets library to get rid of the "You seem to be using the 
pipelines sequentially on GPU. In order to maximize efficiency, please 
use a dataset." warning from huggingface
- graph dates + covid article sentiment Analysis
- dates with welfare articles sentiment analysis
- get up and running with adroit bc this cpu run time is getting ridiculous
- make a research informed model looking for frames using different words
instead of sentiment analysis
- see how the two compare
- write the fucking paper
