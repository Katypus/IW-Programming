Embattled influencer brothers Andrew and Tristan Tate returned to a Romanian police station on Monday to comply with a court-mandated order to present themselves to authorities as they face a litany of legal battles in multiple countries.\u00a0 The brothers are mandated to check in with authorities to maintain compliance with judicial control requirements as they face charges of human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to sexually exploit women.\u00a0 While outside the Voluntari police station, Andrew Tate told reporters, \"I\u2019m a free person who has not been convicted of anything,\" vowing to \"comply with all judicial authorities everywhere around the world because I\u2019m completely innocent.\"\u00a0 ANDREW TATE, BROTHER TRISTAN SUED FOR ALLEGEDLY SEX TRAFFICKING AMERICAN WOMAN TO FOREIGN COUNTRY Andrew Tate reacts while speaking to reporters after checking in at a police station as part of his judicial control, which requires him to appear before judicial authorities in Romania when summoned, after returning from the United States, in Voluntari, Romania, Monday, March 24, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda) The brothers were indicted last year after being arrested in Romania in 2022. Prosecutors allege the Tates, who are dual U.S. and British citizens, spent years involved in a criminal ring that lured women to Romania for sexual exploitation. Andrew Tate, a former MMA fighter and self-described misogynist, was also charged with rape.\u00a0 The men have vehemently denied all allegations and pleaded not guilty.\u00a0 The Tates remain under judicial control after a court ruled the case could not go to trial, citing numerous prosecutorial irregularities. However, court-mandated stipulations require them to periodically appear before authorities.\u00a0 Attorneys for Andrew and Tristan Tate did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\u00a0 ANDREW AND TRISTAN TATE FACE FLORIDA CRIMINAL PROBE DAYS AFTER US HOMECOMING Andrew Tate waves next to his brother Tristan as they check in at a police station as part of their judicial control, which requires them to appear before judicial authorities in Romania when summoned, after returning from the United States, in Voluntari, Romania, Monday, March 24, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda) Monday\u2019s check-in comes two days after the brothers flew back to Romania on a private flight from the U.S. The pair arrived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, last month after Romanian officials lifted a two-year travel ban implemented upon them.\u00a0 Their arrival was met with the cold shoulder from Florida Gov. Ron Desantis\u2019 administration, with state Attorney General James Uthmeier vowing to launch a \"preliminary inquiry\" into the brothers and opening an investigation into Andrew and Tristan Tate on March 4.\u00a0 \"Florida has zero tolerance for human trafficking and violence against women,\" Uthmeier said in a statement posted to social media. \"If any of these alleged crimes trigger Florida jurisdiction, we will hold them accountable.\"\u00a0 ANDREW TATE, BROTHER TRISTAN RETURN TO US AFTER ROMANIAN PROSECUTORS LIFT TRAVEL BAN IN TRAFFICKING CASE Andrew Tate speaks to reporters as he leaves in a vehicle after checking in at a police station as part of his judicial control, which requires him to appear before judicial authorities in Romania when summoned, in Voluntari, Romania, Monday, March 24, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda) On Monday, Andrew Tate accused DeSantis of \"being hijacked by the media,\" telling reporters, \"the media jumped on him and he didn\u2019t realize I was an American citizen. Now he understands he made a mistake, [and] there\u2019ve been some conversations and everything has been settled.\"\u00a0 The DeSantis administration did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment.\u00a0 The Romanian court\u2019s decision to bar the brothers\u2019 case from going to trial was a significant blow to the country\u2019s anti-organized crime agency DIICOT, which had filed a second case against the Tates in August of last year. The allegations include claims of human trafficking, money laundering, trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and influencing statements. The brothers have denied the additional charges as well.\u00a0 ROMANIAN AUTHORITIES TOW VEHICLES FROM ANDREW TATE'S HOME AFTER NEW HUMAN TRAFFICKING ALLEGATIONS Andrew Tate laughs before checking in at a police station as part of his judicial control, which requires him to appear before judicial authorities in Romania when summoned, in Voluntari, Romania, Monday, March 24, 2025.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda) The pair\u2019s legal woes are not only confined to Romania, with four British women filing civil lawsuits in the U.K. after the country\u2019s Crown Prosecution Service opted not to file criminal charges.\u00a0 The Tates also face extradition to the U.K. following the conclusion of their Romanian legal proceedings after authorities issued arrest warrants over sexual aggression allegations spanning from 2012 to 2025.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re accused of, it matters what you are proven guilty to have done in a fair court of law,\" Andrew Tate said on Monday. \"Accusations mean nothing.

A Maryland woman who thought she hit the jackpot Friday night ended up going home with jack squat -- all because of a typo. Cynthia Obie told FOX5DC she was at the MGM National Harbor in Oxon Hill, Md. when her slot machine's symbols suddenly aligned and she won a tremendous payout. \u201cI was very excited. Like, I need this money,\u201d Obie told the news station. But Obie said that when\u00a0casino staff took down her personal information, they misread her Social Security \u2014 by one number. That mistake cost Obie nearly everything. The Social Security number the casino plugged in belonged to an individual who happened to owe Maryland a hefty amount of child support, FOX5DC reported.

I\u2019m like, 'this can\u2019t be right,'\u201d she said. The Maryland woman said she would have been thousands of dollars richer by now -- she did not reveal the exact amount of the jackpot -- but the typo prevented her from getting a\u00a0penny. Instead, she was offered a $200 free play credit and drink vouchers for the night.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP An MGM spokesperson said in a statement to FOX5DC the casino is\u00a0aware of the \u201cunfortunate error\u201d and is working on fixing the situation. \u201cDue to MLGCA [Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency] rules and Maryland State Law, we cannot provide an additional payout for this jackpot, however, if she presents the proper identification credentials to the Maryland Gaming Commission, they will provide her with the appropriate payout,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe apologize for the inconvenience this has caused Ms. Obie.\u201d Obie said she\u2019s frustrated with the situation and just wants the money she won. \u201cNow I\u2019m at the point, this is insane.

HURRICANE IAN DISPLACED SCORES OF PETS IN FLORIDA: WHERE ARE THEY NOW? The airlift freed up space, amid the hurricane, for many displaced pets in southern shelters \u2014 sending others to rescue centers in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

This is a rush transcript of \u2018Fox News Sunday\u2019 on October 16, 2022. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Shannon Bream.Just 23 days from now, Americans will tell us who they want to run Washington.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are better positioned than any other major economy in the world.BREAM: President Biden on a West Coast swing to tout his work on the economy despite a series of negative reports this week, and has this message for voters.BIDEN: If Republican wins, inflation is going to get worse. It's that simple.BREAM: While brand new FOX News polls show Americans are feeling the squeeze of inflation.We'll ask White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein about the administration's plans to combat rising prices.Plus --REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): The American people are looking for a new direction and House Republicans have a plan.BREAM: Congressional Republicans say they are bullish on their chances to take the House in November.REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): We're going to fire Nancy Pelosi.BREAM: But are they succeeding in making their case to voters?We'll show you what our polls say.And we'll speak live with the number two Republican in the House, Congressman Steve Scalise, about his party's plans should they take the majority.Then --REP. BENNIE THOMPSON (D-MS): This investigation is not about politics.BREAM: The committee investigating the January 6th riot at the Capitol votes to subpoena former President Trump, just ahead of the midterms.We'll ask our Sunday panel about the 11th hour move and whether Trump would comply.Then --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These artifacts have actually never been on display before here at CIA Museum.BREAM: One of the most secretive buildings in the country opens up and our Jennifer Griffin takes you there to tour its treasures.All, right now, on \"FOX News Sunday.\"(END VIDEOTAPE)BREAM (on camera): And hello from FOX News in Washington.Voters are weeks away from speaking their minds in the 2022 midterms. Top lines from our brand new FOX poll show presidential approval will be critical for Democrats. And right now, it stands at 46 percent. That's actually up 6 points from June.But Democrats still face serious headwinds. Check it out, 79 percent are extremely or very concerned about crime, while fewer, 71 percent say the same about abortion policy. But a whopping 89 percent say they're extremely or very concerned about inflation. In a moment, we will speak live with Jared Bernstein of the White House Council of Economic Advisers about the crushing new inflation numbers out just this week.But, first, a look at how these issues are animating the country's biggest races, starting with abortion.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)TUDOR DIXON (R), MICHIGAN GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: The governor doesn't have the choice to go around a judge or a constitutional amendment.GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER (D), MICHIGAN: A governor will absolutely impact these rights.BREAM (voice-over): The debate over a Michigan ballot measure that would enshrine the right to abortion is taking a center stage in this week's gubernatorial debates. Democrats pin their hopes on angry voters coming out in droves after the end of Roe v. Wade.But our brand new FOX polls show only 50 percent of registered voters say Democrats handle the issues better. And there are other measures issues dogging candidates like crime.DR. MEHMET OZ (R), PENNSYLVANIA SENTE CANDIDATE: It seems to a lot of voters inside Philadelphia that the criminals are being valued more than the innocent.JOHN FETTERMAN (D), PENNSYLVANIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR: I'm actually effective on crime and I believe in second chances. And I've run on that record.BREAM: As the Pennsylvania Senate race tightens, voters who say crime is their top concern favor Republicans, 52-34 percent. And polls show the economy remains a major concern, putting Democratic Senate candidates like Ohio's Tim Ryan on defense over how President Biden is handling inflation.REP. TIM RYAN (D-OH): The problem we're having now with inflation is our supply chains went to China. And guys like him made a lot of money off that.J.D. VANCE (R), OHIO SENATE CANDIDATE: China's problems are exacerbated by our own leadership's failures. Those failures go back 20 years to when Tim Ryan started in Congress.(END VIDEOTAPE)BREAM: Joining us now, White House Council of Economic Advisers member, Jared Bernstein.Welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday\".JARED BERNSTEIN, WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: Thanks for inviting me. Great to see you again.BREAM: You, too.OK. Let's start here. The headline in \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning says: economists are putting the probability of a recession in the next 12 months at 63 percent. That's up from 49 percent in July's survey. Soft landing will likely remain a mythical outcome.Over at \"The New York Times\", they say it's not going well. Underlying inflation trends are headed in the wrong direction.Now, September numbers were worse than forecast. August and September helped a little by gas prices going down.BERNSTEIN: Right.BREAM: They seem to be moving in the wrong direction right now.Is it time to admit the massive federal spending under this administration is not only not helping Americans, it may be hurting them?BERNSTEIN: Let's start right there, Shannon. I think it's a really important to get this number $1.4 trillion into the discussion right now. That's the amount of deficit reduction in fiscal year '22, okay? That comes on top of about $350 billion in deficit reduction in the year before that. So, this --BREAM: As we talked about, that comes off of massive COVID spending.BERNSTEIN: Well, actually, part of it is unwinding of COVID spending, you're right about that.But in percent terms, the bigger contributor to that decline in deficit spending is receipts, receipts coming into the Treasury, and that's because of how strong the economy has been.And that also gets to the question you just raised and this issue of recession. We have an unemployment rate that's 3.5 percent, okay? There is no recession that would prevail with that kind of unemployment rate. We're obviously adding hundreds of thousands of jobs per month.We have consumers who still have pretty strong balance sheets. We have job vacancies that are quite elevated. So, there's a lot of talent in the economy, a lot of strength.And when President Biden just said on the tape you played that the U.S. is uniquely positioned to do two things, to ease the price pressures we face which are very real, you correctly referenced them right out of the gate. We called them like they are, squeezing family budgets, while maintaining these economic gains.That's our mission. We believe we can accomplish that. We actually think the probability for a soft landing is good.BREAM: OK. In that \"Wall Street Journal\" piece, they also talk about predictions for Q1, Q2 next year to also be negative territory. Would you concede then? Because a lot of people do use the definition two bad quarters, negative action, equals recession. You're saying we're not there right now.BERNSTEIN: Correct.BREAM: But if we went through continued negative quarters through the first half of '23, would you then admit we're in a recession?BERNSTEIN: First of all, it is not up to the White House to call recession. That's called by an economic group of --BREAM: But you, Jared Bernstein.BERNSTEIN: Yeah, what I -- I would look at the following variables, happens to be the same ones that the group I was just talking about -- retail sales, payroll employment, consumer spending, industrial production, all of those have not been flashing red. All of those are not in recessionary territory.Now, if you ask me to look around the corner and say where the economy is going to be, I got to tell you that everybody's crystal ball is a bit cracked right now.BREAM: That's -- yes.BERNSTEIN: The uncertainty out there makes it tough.But let's talk about energy which is so key here, okay? You just mentioned it yourself. In this consumer price report, where prices were, no question, elevated to a point that family budgets are squeezed, gas was down 5 percent.And, in fact, the price of gas fell about a third in the third quarter of this year. Now, remember, it peaked out north of $5 a gallon, last seen, it was $3.89. I know because I checked this morning.BREAM: So did I.BERNSTEIN: And there are 14 states with price of gas at $3.50 or below.So, that's some progress and it relates to President Biden's release of oil from the Strategic Reserves.BREAM: OK. How long can we do that?BERNSTEIN: Good question.BREAM: If we're doing millions of barrels at a time, there is a bottom to that.BERNSTEIN: So I knew you'd ask me that because I know you're very interested in the Strategic Reserve and its capacity.BREAM: As all Americans should be.BERNSTEIN: Yeah, as all -- on Sunday morning, what else are we thinking about than SPR capacity?BREAM: Basically.BERNSTEIN: OK. There is -- there are still 400 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Reserve. It is more than half full.I think people don't quite have the capacity number in their head. We've never done a draw that's of that magnitude. And the largest draw that we've ever done that President Biden presided over in March is 180 million barrels.So, the fact is there is capacity to use the SPR to deal with some of the energy shocks we're seeing in the world. But I'm not saying we will. That's up to the president to decide, he hasn't made that decision yet.But if you look at unconscionable action of Putin, weaponizing energy, amplified by the short-sighted and misguided decision by OPEC Plus recently, then sure, having the SPR there for potential release is an important --BREAM: OK.BERNSTEIN: -- important tool.BREAM: And when those prices move in the right direction, that is a good thing, to ripple to the other issues that show up in the CPI.BERNSTEIN: Right.BREAM: But let's talk about this. When President Biden took office, you know, inflation was about 3 percent. Gas prices were about $2.39 I think a gallon. So, we can't possibly say that things have gotten better or anywhere near where they were two years ago.Let's talk about the realities for folks. Groceries up 13 percent last month -- year to year eggs more than 30 percent, milk more than 15 percent.Our new polling shows that 71 percent of Americans say they are having to cut back just to afford necessities, not anything fun or luxurious.BERNSTEIN: Uh-huh.BREAM: And also, they say that compared to the situation two years ago, they are worse off, majority of them. So, what do you say to those numbers though? This has happened in your watch.BERNSTEIN: Yeah. So, here's -- let me speak to them directly, which is all those facts are facts of which we are acutely aware.And when President Biden came out to talk about this last inflation where he started by talking about exactly that, the squeeze on family budgets. And I think you have to ask yourself, is this administration doing what we need to do to help ease those pressures?Now, remember, these are global price pressures. All of the statistics you just cited -- they're actually worse in Europe and the UK. Inflation is higher there in part because they're --BREAM: Not necessarily.BERNSTEIN: Well, they're more --BREAM: Not in France, for example.BERNSTEIN: OK. But in the E.U., in general, I know inflation is double digits there, and the U.K. as well. And the reason is because they're more exposed to energy. And we just went through some of the energy numbers.But I think what you have to ask yourself, Shannon, more importantly what people that you're talking to have to ask, do we have the policy set and is the Fed doing what it needs to do to ease these price pressures.Now, you know the Inflation Reduction Act passed. This is a -- this is a measure that lowers prescription drug costs, that lowers the cost of insulin, that lowers the cost of medical care. There are 13 million families who'll be paying $800 less per year. If you are paying $10,000, if you're someone on Medicare, on your prescription drugs, you're going to save $8,000 under the IRA.So, these measures are in effect and Republicans have said they want to take them away. So, if you are paying hundreds of dollars on insulin per month and now you get to pay $35 starting in January, they want to take that away. That to me is a recipe for more inflation, higher costs, not easing the pressures that you just took us through.BREAM: OK. I will ask Steve Scalise, the congressman is going to be with us in just minutes, we'll ask him about that.In the meantime, let's talk mortgages because we talked about this a little bit before we got started. Let's use the example of a median home price, about $390,000, 20 percent down, back when insurance -- or excuse me, inflation rate was about 3.05 percent, that would have been $1,000 -- $1,324 a month, okay?So, let's fast forward that to now because mortgage rates have more than doubled this year alone. So, if you took that same house at 6.92 mortgage, $2,000 a month, it's $735 more each month. That's thousands and thousands of dollars for an average family if they want to get into a home price now.The Fed is expected to hike rates November, December. We'll see how that far goes on. But the Fed chair has actually said there will be some pain, those are his words, with these hikes.How painful is it going to get?BERNSTEIN: Well, I think you have to distinguish between people who are buying homes now and the vast majority of mortgage holders who locked in rates that are much lower than that.You're definitely right that, you know, at that margin, the price of financing a mortgage, of course, goes up with the interest rate and with the mortgage rate. But again I think this gets to the question of are we implementing -- by we, I mean not just the federal government, but in this case the Federal Reserve as well -- are we implementing the necessary policies to ease inflationary pressures?I would say the answer is unequivocally yes. Now, we're not going to get into the Feds knitting, because we respect an independent Federal Reserve. But the president has very much approved of rate hiking campaign because they're the first and foremost inflation fighter.Now, one of the first sectors that experiences the impact of rate hikes is housing and the housing sector is cooling. Now, that doesn't find its way into the price index for a while. It comes in with a lag.But if you look at rents, rents have come down significantly. They're still highly elevated in terms of year over year change. But they come down 4, 5 percentage points. That's going to take a while to feed into the CPI, but it is moving the right direction.And so, that's what I'm trying to get across here. That whether it's Inflation Reduction Act, whether it's our work in ports, whether it is our work with energy and the release of oil from reserves, we are doing all we can to ease inflationary pressures and we see results.It's going to take time for those results to get into the price. We would like to see that happen a whole lot faster. We're going to try to work to make that happen.BREAM: Yeah --BERNSTEIN: But we are engaged in the appropriate policies (INAUDIBLE).BREAM: OK. So, let me put up these poll numbers then because the American people are confused about that. They don't think your policies are working.When it comes to how the president is doing on the economy and the inflation, he is upside down by a wide margin in our latest polling.So, why aren't they getting the message? I mean, clearly, people don't feel like this is working for them yet at home.BERNSTEIN: I think because so much what's going on inflation gets just down to the trip to the supermarket --BREAM: Right.BERNSTEIN: -- and the trip to the gas station.I think if you ask people how they feel about paying over $5 of gas in mid June, and well under $4 now, I think it's about $3.89 nationally, $3.50 in 14 states, including Florida, North Carolina, and Texas. So, some significant population there, they tell you they feel pretty good about that.And I think it's unequivocal that the president's fingerprints are on that decline in part because of the release of oil from the reserves. We're doing what we can in the food space.I think that another reason -- another answer to your question, Shannon, is that some of what happens is getting back to normal, which consumers don't always recognize. So shelves are now stocked basically as they were pre- pandemic. People don't see containers going in and out of ports, but, in fact, the through put of containers getting through ports is back to where it was. In fact, it's ahead of where it was pre-pandemic.BREAM: But back to normal, like $2.39 for gas, are we going to get back to that normal?BERNSTEIN: I'm sorry?BREAM: Two thirty-nine a gallon --BERNSTEIN: Yeah, I don't --BREAM: -- when the president took office?BERNSTEIN: Certainly don't -- it's very hard to look around the corner and see where gas prices are going that far ahead. As I noted, they've come down significantly.Most recently, they started ticking back down again, just a few cents in the past few days, and it has to do with refineries coming on line in the Midwest and in California.I think the key story there is that is this administration doing as much as we can to help increase the energy supply? And I think the answer is unequivocally yes.BREAM: Well, I don't know, because a lot of folks would say if you're not -- you know, helping with permitting and drilling, and encouraging domestic production, you're not doing everything.BERNSTEIN: So, let me read you a headline I just saw. This is from \"The Sierra Club\" the other day, just article that just came out.For all of its good, the new climate legislation also mandates oil and gas drilling on public land.So, that's \"The Sierra Club\" complaining about aspects of the Inflation Reduction Act that open up new lands for leasing. Now, the Inflation Reduction Act also invests $370 billion in hastening this very urgent transition to clean energy.So this is a walk and chew gum moment. I don't think that anyone can, based on the facts, accuse this administration of not fulfilling both of those obligations right now.BREAM: Well, a lot of refiners say they're having trouble managing the threat they took from the administration during the campaign that we're going to get rid of fossil fuel, toiling (ph) up for green and now trying to toil back for crude.BERNSTEIN: Wait a second, Shannon. We have American oil producers about to produce next year a record number of barrels per day. So we have a highly productive system in that regard. We're the largest oil producer in the land, in natural gas where -- I'm sorry, in the world. Natural gas, we're also way far ahead of competitors in that regard.So I think whether it's permitting or whether it's American oil production, that's just a red herring. We're doing a lot there. We're producing a lot of energy.I think the key thing that we need to learn from this lesson, and it's a geopolitical lesson, is that we need to do both. We need to make sure we're helping consumers at the pump today while we urgently transition to clean energy.BREAM: OK. Jared Bernstein, it is always great to have you in with us for discussion on Sunday. Thank you for coming in.BERNSTEIN: My pleasure. Thank you, Shannon.BREAM: All right. Up next, we're going to get reaction from the second ranking Republican in the House and we'll get those brand new FOX News polls know about the GOP agenda or don't know. That's next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: House Republicans making a big push in recent weeks to sell voters on their post-midterm plans. They call it \"Commitment to America\". But is it catching on?Joining us now, House Republican Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana.Congressman, welcome back to \"FOX News Sunday.\"REP. STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Good morning, Shannon. Great to be with you.BREAM: OK. Let's start here. Democrats are pointing to your own documents to tell Americans that you are preparing to cut entitlements.Here's what the headline is: House GOP decides slashing is the new saving. This year's Republican Study Committee's fiscal year 2023 budget openly calls for slashing and privatizing Social Security, raising the retirement age to 70, and ending Medicare as we know it.Now, I got a tweet from a viewer this week who says, he's a Republican, he's very worried about you cutting his Medicare. He says it's a deal breaker and betrayal by the GOP.So, what's your answer?SCALISE: Well, the answer is that's a typical red herring by Democrats and it's not something we proposed. In fact, we proposed strengthening, and shoring up Medicare and Social Security, which are both, by the way, headed for bankruptcy if we do nothing.Democrats want to make that worse. Democrats actually recently passed a bill to raid money out of Social Security.So, instead of making those programs less stable, what we want to do is shore them up.And, by the way, one of the ways you shore them up is get more people back to work paying into those programs right now. And one of the things Democrats did on day one when they came in taking over the House, Senate and the White House, is to start paying people not to work, to see more of the welfare programs where you used to have work requirements in place.So you would have a real safety net which we believe in. But why should we be paying people to sit at home when there are companies everywhere looking for workers?Everywhere you go, you go to a restaurant, you're waiting an hour for a table, and you're seeing a third of them empty because the government started paying people not to work. That drains programs like Social Security and Medicare.So, let's strengthen those programs, and stop them from going bankrupt. And let's also, by the way, stop the government getting in this business of paying people not to work when everybody is looking for workers right now.BREAM: But fair to say that pointing to your own documents, there are some changes to these programs that would happen.SCALISE: There's not anything that we propose in Commitment to America. In fact, the Commitment to America, we talk specifically about --BREAM: In the fiscal year that the Democrats are referring to.(CROSSTALK)SCALISE: No, in the Commitment to America, we talk -- well, they didn't do a budget this year. You know, if you look at what they've done, they pass bills to increase taxes.I know your previous guest, Mr. Bernstein, talked about a bill they passed to raise over $730 billion in new taxes, and, by the way, more than double the size of the IRS, sending 87,000 agents after hardworking families, and, in fact, even the Joint Committee on Taxation confirmed they're going after people making less than $200,000 a year, which is a violation of the White House's own promise.BREAM: OK, but --SCALISE: President Biden said he wouldn't do that.We're shoring up -- we want to shore up Social Security and Medicare.(CROSSTALK)BREAM: Just to be clear, the Republican Study Committee's budget. So, that's something you signed on to, that's what Democrats are pointing to to say there will be changes to these programs, if -- if your budget passed.SCALISE: Well, first of all, that -- yeah, that budget talks about shoring up and strengthening Social Security. That's not cutting Social Security. That's making sure for people that are on Social Security today, if nothing happens, there would be automatic cuts in law.We don't want that to happen. And so, we've brought forward legislation to stave off cuts to Medicare. We want to stave off cuts to Social Security.Democrats haven't supported any of that. They want the programs to go bankrupt. That's not a good thing.We don't want Medicare and Social Security to go bust like the Democrats right now have us on a track to do.BREAM: OK. Let's talk about some polling. These are some interesting new numbers just out this morning, where we asked people about who they prefer as congressional candidate. There is a three point advantage there to Democrats.And when asked about how they felt about the House Republicans' Commitment to America, majority of them said they were totally unfamiliar with the program.Do Republicans have a messaging problem in the midterms?SCALISE: In fact, we just rolled this out. And I've been to a lot of districts in the last few weeks since we rolled it out in Pittsburgh, and I tell you what, people are responding very positive to it.Number one, we've got phenomenal candidates, and we're going to win races in a lot of places you haven't seen. I was in the Northwest, Washington state, Oregon, where we're going to flip seats.I was a few weeks ago in the Northeast, up in Maine, all the way down to Florida where on the Eastern Seaboard, we're going to be flipping a lot of seats from Democrats to Republican.You know what they tell me, Shannon, they are furious with Biden and Pelosi's far-left socialist agenda that's led to increased spending, increased inflation, just the cost of everything you buy when you go to the grocery store, if you can afford to put gas in your car when you get there.And look, the White House and Jared Bernstein just before me, they're talking, bragging as if gas prices are lower. Gas prices are about 60 percent higher today than when Joe Biden took office, and he shut off American energy production. That's why it happened.He's allowed OPEC, foreign countries. He's begged -- Biden's begged Russia, he's begged Iran, Venezuela, and other countries to produce oil when we should be producing it in America.We do it cleaner than anywhere else. And by the way, if we produce more energy in America, we would be lowering energy costs like we had two years ago.People are furious about all that. They're furious also about rising crime because Democrats embraced not only the defund the police movement, one of the craziest ideas I've ever heard. But now, they're going cashless bail, letting criminals on the streets after they committed violent crimes against families. And that's one of the reasons crime is out of control, and people are furious about that, too.And so, they want a check and balance on this far left agenda.BREAM: OK. So, let's talk about the crime issue because that is one of the areas that polling shows us, the voters give Republicans a distinct advantage. They think that you are better equipped to handle that.But critics say that you're scare-mongering about what's actually happening. They say some of these ads from Republicans on the issue of crime have racial undertones.Here's something from \"The Washington Post\", an opinion piece. It says: violent crime is not soaring. In fact, it might be declining. Most violent crime is committed by White people and violent crime is generally worse in Republican-run states.Your response?SCALISE: Well, first of all, violent crime is out of control in most big cities. And that's what we have been focusing on. So, I guess they're admitting that their policies have failed.But it's the Democrats who started this about two years ago when they embraced the defund the police movement.And I think, by the way, voters on all spectrums, whether you're Republican, Democrat, Black, White, doesn't matter, you don't want to defund the police. Criminals want to defund the police, but that's who the Democrats sided with.And when they found out the public really hated that idea, they started going to cashless bail, where you literally just have some D.A.s and prosecutors in communities letting criminals walk out on the streets right after committing violent crimes.I mean, we saw it in New York. You know, Lee Zeldin, our candidate for governor, somebody tried to take his life on stage at a political rally, and the guy was let out the next day. That's what's going on that people are furious about. That's why it's a major issue in a lot of these races, and Democrats won't walk away from their defund the police and cashless bail approach that has failed so many cities across America.BREAM: You know the words they use to describe your agenda. They call it extreme MAGA agenda. This is what Speaker Pelosi says about the issue of abortion.She says: 166 House Republicans, including GOP Whip Scalise, have co- sponsored a \"Life Begins at Conception\" bill that would criminalize all abortion after the moment of fertilization with absolutely no exceptions for rape, incest or the health of the woman.That position does not poll well with voters. So, how do you defend it?SCALISE: Well, I'm not a co-sponsor of that bill. The bill I'm a co- sponsor of is the Born Alive Act, which says that if a baby is born alive outside the womb, you can't murder that baby and call it abortion, which, by the way, that's legal in right now in states like New York. There are states where they still would allow you to kill the baby after it's born alive.And I think most Americans, including people who identify as pro-choice think that's radically extreme, don't want that to be the case. Yet that's where Democrats are right now. And, by the way, they also want those abortions paid for by taxpayers, which is also an extreme position.So, they're the ones extreme on this. They keep trying to talk about it. It's back firing on them.And, by the way, people are talking high cost of everything. They're not -- they're not looking at the Democrats' agenda, saying they want more of it. They're saying they're fed up with the far left shift that both Biden and Pelosi have taken us, not down a liberal road but down a socialist road.BREAM: OK.SCALISE: That's what people are rejecting.BREAM: I want to be --SCALISE: That's what we're proposing an alternative to with the Commitment to America.BREAM: I want to be clear, though, did you sign onto as a co-sponsor of \"Life Begins at Conception\", that act? Did the speaker get (ph) that wrong?(CROSSTALK)SCALISE: No, I'm on the Born Alive -- I'm on the Born Alive Act.BREAM: OK, I want to --SCALISE: And go look up the Born Alive Act. Again, it says if a baby is born alive outside the womb, you can't murder that baby and call it abortion. Not a single Democrat in Washington supports that bill. That's how radical they are.And so, that's the kind of thing that we're talking about.BREAM: All right. Congressman, I want to be sure to ask. We are more than five years out from a shooting by a gunman -- list of lawmakers, clearly had a very political viewpoint for why he came after you and your colleagues at that congressional baseball practice. How are you doing five years later, and how worried are you about heated political rhetoric whether it's on the left or the right?SCALISE: Yes, Shannon, I appreciate that. I - I continue to get better. I still do physical therapy once a week. And, look, I'm - I'm lucky to be alive. A hero saved my life. Police saved my life that were there that day. Brad Winstrup, my colleague, saved my life. So, there's a lot of heroes that were involved in - in me being alive.And, you know, look, We always speak out against political violence. There's no place for it. This is the United States of America. And one of our strengths is that we can disagree and we don't -- the other side isn't the demon or the enemy if they're having a different viewpoint. You know, you try to debate. You try to go make your case and - and ultimately persuade people to your side. But political violence is never an answer to resolve our disputes.BREAM: Well, Congressman, we know there are a lot of weighty problems to tackle on The Hill and we hope and pray that the two sides can find some common ground.Thank you very much for your time this morning.SCALISE: God bless. Thanks, Shannon.BREAM: You too.Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group on what happens next now that a House committee has voted unanimously to subpoena former President Trump. We'll tell you what he's says about whether he would actually show up and testify.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I was able to bring gasoline down well over $1.60 (ph), but it's - it's inching up because of what the Russians and - and the Saudis just did.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: President Biden focusing blame outside the U.S. for the high gas prices we've been seeing in recent weeks.It is time now for our Sunday group. Senior politics reporter for \"Axios,\" Josh Kraushaar, editor-in-chief of \"The Federalist,\" Mollie Hemingway, Fox News contributor Richard Fouler, and president of The Heritage Foundation, Kevin Robert.Welcome to all of you.Let's start there on this gas price issue.\"The Wall Street Journal\" opinion piece on Thursday says blaming Saudi Arabia or OPEC Plus or Vladimir Putin for an energy crisis that results from a policy of switching from carbon fuels to clean energy is disingenuous. The oil prices U.S. consumers pay are due to choices their leaders made.Kevin, you heard Jared Bernstein with me earlier in the show. He said they are ramping up production. We're doing great on the U.S. production side.KEVIN ROBERT, PRESIDENT, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION: Jared Bernstein's a nice guy but he's dead wrong. If you talk to Americans that know that gas prices are going up, at the same time they hear the president of the United States giving fist bump to leader of Saudi Arabia and also telling us that the solution is to buy energy efficient coffee makers. The way back to controlling inflation and American independence is going back to where we were just in 2019, Shannon, when America was a net oil exporter, that's beneficial for every American, even Americans who think that wind and solar production is a sweet thing.BREAM: And don't mess with the coffee makers. I think everybody's going to agree, Americans, you're going to have to settle them on that.Meantime, the president has also said this week, if you elect Republicans, if you give the GOP control, you just watch inflation, it's going to get terrible. This is the headline over at your place, \"The Federalist.\" Molly, they say, get ready for Democrats' new strategy blaming future Biden inflation on a GOP Congress. We've seen that pretty uniformly this week.MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"THE FEDERALIST\" AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, it's a fascinating strategy to try to blame Republicans when Democrats control the White House, both houses of Congress. And we have seen that American voters very much are aware of inflation, rising costs, problems with the economy. And that's actually one of the issues that they say is motivating them to vote.And you look at, you know, all these polls that are out there that show that on the issues that American voters care about, whether it's inflation, the economy, crime, you know, these - these types of issues, they're tending to say that they think Republicans will do a better job. So, they can try that messaging but I don't know how much sway it's going to have with the voter.BREAM: I want to make sure we also get to the January 6th committee. We think this week was the last hearing, although they are saying it's not set in stone. There could be more things to come. But as part of this, at the end of the hearing, they voted unanimously to subpoena President Trump.Professor Jonathan Turley, a law professor we have on quite a bit, said this about waiting to the last minute of the last that we know of hearing to do the subpoena. He says the delay undermines the credibility of the effort from the first day the J6 committee said Trump was central to its investigation.So, Richard, did they risk this looking like political theater because they've waited till the last minute to drop this bomb?RICHARD FOWLER, FORBES CONTRIBUTING WRITER AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think that's going to be in the minds of the viewers - mind of the voters that go to the polls. But I think it's worth pointing out here that from the beginning of this committee, and even if you talk to folks in Trump's camp, they - he wanted more Republicans on the committee, and it was - it was Kevin McCarthy who said no to that. And I think, as we sit here now and we watch some of the harrowing (ph) behind the scenes footage that we saw Speaker Pelosi and pictures of Vice President Mike Pence scrambling to try to save the United States Capitol, who's missing from that picture is former President Donald Trump, which we find - which we saw last March. A federal judge said that he's most likely one of the causes for this.So, I think this subpoena, while we - I like -- I doubt that we'll see Donald Trump on Capitol Hill, I think this subpoena speaks to where the January 6th riot started and how we got here.HEMINGWAY: I just have to correct really quickly. It's not true that Kevin McCarthy is responsible for no Republicans being on the committee.FOWLER: No, no, no. Well -HEMINGWAY: He actually did appoint members to that committee. Nancy Pelosi refused to seat them. Which has never happened in the history of congressional investigations or congressional committees. And so it's not that this lost credibility at this point, it actually never had credibility because there was not a single Republican appointed member on that committee, so it always looked partisan. And it also always looked --BREAM: But (INAUDIBLE) say he then - he then pulled everybody. McCarthy then pulled -HEMINGWAY: Well, but - but because Nancy Pelosi removed his top two members. That's never happened in the history of Congress.FOWLER: But, Mollie, it's also worth pointing out, what you see throughout - what you're seeing through every hearing is you've seen high-level, high- ranking Trump officials testifying, showing that the president was not active on January 6th.HEMINGWAY: Yes, so there was no due process on the committee and I think -FOWLER: We also showed -- they also showed evidence that - that he - he didn't have - he didn't protect the Capitol on January 6th. We also show evidence --BREAM: I did -HEMINGWAY: What I think this shows is that - it shows that Democrats are very focused on this while the American voter is worried about how they're going to pay for their groceries, how they're going to pay for gas, and that this is their final closing message. I think it's going to go as poorly for Democrats this year as it went for Republicans in 1998.BREAM: So, one of the key players in this has been Republican Liz Cheney, who, obviously, lost her primary and she's not going to be returning to Congress, but this is what she said about this waiting to the last minute for the subpoena.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)REP. LIZ CHENEY (R-WY): I think we have felt it's very important that the investigation be conducted in a way that is rigorous and disciplined and responsible.Collecting evidence from all those around the central figure in January 6th before we issued a subpoena for him.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: So, Josh, she says this was just the natural progression of their investigation.JOSH KRAUSHAAR, SENIOR POLITICS REPORTER, \"AXIOS\": Well, the bigger challenge for Cheney and the Democrats on the January 6th committee is that if Republicans take back the House, they could just withdraw the subpoena. So, this becomes - I mean, really, this is coming down to the - the political reality as much as the substantive revelations we learned from the hearings.And as Mollie was saying, Republicans and Democrats alike are not focused on January 6th. Two percent - just 2 percent of the advertisements from Republicans and Democrats are focused on January 6th. Crime, the economy, immigration even rank much higher when you look at the messaging across all these big battleground states.So, I think Cheney - I mean the hearings were very important and demonstrated what actually happened on January 6th. But most voters are looking forward and they're not paying attention to the hearings, they're paying attention to their pocketbooks.BREAM: Well, I think something that would make people pay attention is if the former president decided to show up. And he's like, yes, I'll do it. Let's bring it on. But he wants it to be live and he wants to make a lot of points that he wants to make.Kevin, in any universe, does any of that happen?ROBERT: I don't think so. I mean, ultimately, I think the president and his team know that the January 6th committee is a sham. The very first thing that Leader McCarthy needs to do when he's speaker is end it. And he ought to let Harriet Hagaman, who thankfully beat Liz Cheney in Wyoming, author the resolution. That would make Americans happy.BREAM: All right. Well, we'll see as it proceeds. The report is still forthcoming.In the meantime, stay with us because we've got a lot more to talk about.Up next, we're going to take you to Georgia for this week's must watch Senate debate with a look at what became its biggest viral moment.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): One thing I have not done, I've never pretended to be a police officer and - and - and I've never -- I've never threatened a shootout with the police.HERSCHEL WALKER (R), SENATE CANDIDATE FOR GEORGIA: You know what's so funny, I am - work with many police officers. And at the same time, have - have --UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Walker. Mr. Walker.WALKER: No, no, no, no, no, when he said a problem with the truth -UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Walker - Mr. Walker, excuse me, Mr. Walker.WALKER: When he said a problem with the truth, the truth is - is here.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Please, out of respect, I - I - I need to let you know, Mr. Walker -WALKER: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You are very well aware of the rules tonight.WALKER: Yes. Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And you have a prop.WALKER: Yes.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: That is not allowed, sir.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: No badges allowed. OK, that was Georgia Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock and his opponent, Republican Herschel Walker, in one of the most shared exchanges from their heated Friday debate over the badge. Both candidates went on offense, trading shots on each other's records, as well as on health care costs and abortion.All right, we are back with the panel now.So, we need to talk about the issue of abortion. It obviously came up with personal respect to Herschel Walker. He continues to say it is a lie, that he funded an abortion for a past girlfriend who has made that claim. But there was also this exchange from the two on the issue of abortion.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)WARNOCK: The patient's room is too narrow and small and cramped of space for a woman, her doctor, and the United States government.WALKER: He's a neat (ph) talker, but did he not mention that there's a baby in that room as well.(END VIDEO CLIP)BREAM: OK, so, Josh, they talked more broadly about it, but they talked about the personal accusations and his denials on this issue too.KRAUSHAAR: Yes, I mean, there's the personal aspect with Walker allegedly paying for an ex-girlfriend's abortion, and then there's the policy debate over whether, you know, Georgia voters are pro-choice or pro-life. Republicans hope this is a race that comes down to the environment, right? They're hoping that Georgia voters are going to want to check the Democratic power. And that was the -- Walker did a pretty good job. Like, if that -- if the goal was to say I'm not like Warnock, I'm going to vote with Republicans, and that's why you should support Herschel Walker, then he was successful. But if it's about baggage, personal issues, about the candidates themselves, that's what Democrats are hoping prevails in Georgia. They think Warnock is a stronger candidate and voters are going to vote not just on the issues but on the candidates' personal strengths.BREAM: I mean Walker is one of the candidates that has given the GOP some adjeda (ph), a bit of a headache. This is a headline, \"The Washington Post\" opinion this week, McConnell admits it, the GOP's Senate candidates are liabilities.And now, Mollie, it's coming down to a handful of races where there have been some very difficult things that have popped up for GOP candidates and how they handle those issues.HEMINGWAY: It's also just true, though, that Americans are dissatisfied with how Washington, D.C., is doing things. So, Republican voters did nominate a bunch of outsider candidates. Whether you view that as a liability, if you're someone like McConnell, or a strength, because you're hoping to make some very significant changes to how - how things operate in this country is up for - is up for debate.But I think, you know, one thing that was interesting last night's debate, we'd been told that Walker was a very bad candidate. In fact, he did a really interesting and impressive performance in his debate on that abortion question. He didn't just point out that the unborn child is left out of a lot of these discussions, he also pointed out that Raphael Warnock wants everyone to pay for abortions, taxpayers to be forced to pay for abortions. So he said, he's talking about having the government outside of the bedroom, but here he's actually bringing us all back into that bedroom by forcing us to pay for something that, you know, a lot of Americans do not want to pay for.BREAM: Yes, that's clearly one of the big issues on the campaign trail.Let's talk about some more of our Fox News polls.When asked who they prefer for, generically, a congressional seat, the Democrats are at a three point advantage. But that's all registered voters. When we dug a little deeper, those who feel certain to vote, they give a one point advantage to Republicans.Kevin, why is this so tight if Republicans had had this, you know, representation there was going to be a red tsunami, well now it's a ripple, where - you know, what do Republicans do, how have they kind of bungled what was a lead for them at one point?ROBERTS: Actually those numbers, if you look at the history of polls last 60 or 70 years, indicate that the Republicans are doing well. I happen to think they could be doing even better if they had an even more robust policy agenda that focused on restoring self-governance to the American people. But, ultimately, just to get to the political science of it, Shannon, when Republicans on the generic ballot are within two or three points of the Democrats on - on generic preference, they win. And so I think the Republicans are going to outperform, probably pick up 30 to 40 seats.BREAM: OK, what about the Senate?ROBERTS: I'm also predicting a Republican senate, 51, 52, 53 Senate seats. And you know why? Because the election will turn on what voters care about, the economy and the rule of law, both the border security or the lack thereof, and the -- just tremendous increase in crime. The president and all of the people running on his party are messaging on the wrong things and ultimately it's too late for them to turn the corner.BREAM: So, you talk about top issues. We have some of this in our Fox News polling as well. Now, out of the 12 concerns, we ask people to say how they were mot concerned. Two of the top ones, inflation and crime, 89 percent, 79 percent. Voters said that they trust Republicans more than Democrats to handle both by double digits, Richard.FOWLER: Look, don't get me wrong, I think this is going to be a tight election. I'm not going to make any predictions. But I think where Kevin is right is where the Republicans struggle here is that they don't seem to have a clear, distinct message of what they will do if given the gavel and given control of the Capitol.If you talk to folks in the Stacey Abrams campaign, if you talk to folks in Wisconsin on the lieutenant - on Mandela Barnes' campaign, I talked to them this week, they're saying this, we see an expanded electorate, in Georgia specifically. Since 2018, there's been one million new voters added to the voting rolls. So they're going after these new voters.And even in a world where Herschel Walker or Mehmet Oz outperforms their opponent in a debate, herein lies the problem, they're trying to convince a very small group of independents that they are the right close. Whereas in for Democrats, they're working to expand their electorate and they're also working on talking to the folks who aren't part of the Trump wing of the Republican Party, who have already made the decision that they're not going to vote for Republicans in this election.BREAM: Well, and going into the home stretch, there are heavy hitters that are heading back out now. Former President Obama. There had been talk about whether he would show up. In some of the tight races that you mentioned, Josh, he is going to be there. Can it be a difference maker?KRAUSHAAR: Well, look, Democrats don't have a lot of surrogates that they can use that are popular in swing states. So, President Biden's numbers in these swing states are very low. He was in Oregon. That's about as - that's about the battleground map for the president because you can't go to Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, some of these true battlegrounds. Obama is the one surrogate that might be able to make a difference, especially when it comes to turning out the base. Wisconsin, such a big race for the Senate map. He's going to Georgia also for Senator Warnock. Those are going to be tests and see whether Obama and whether the Democratic voter base can get excited about some of their candidates.BREAM: OK, so this week the debate - I think we're all going to pop our popcorn and watch - is the Fetterman/Oz debate in Pennsylvania. What are you going to look for, Mollie?HEMINGWAY: Well, one think that's interesting about that race is that it has been not focused on issues prior to this point because of personality issues, whether it's Fetterman's stroke or Mehmet Oz's, you know, some of the ways he's been focused on issues that aren't important to Pennsylvania. Now the issues really are coming into play. And so I think this debate, we'll actually see where they differ. You know, Fetterman is known for being someone who, as lieutenant governor, has helped some criminals out. That's become a major issue. Crime is becoming a major issues for Americans nationwide. And so I think we'll actually start to see where those - where they differ.BREAM: OK, maybe we'll have a watch party. We'll all get together. Snacks. OK, sign up sheet right afterwards.All right, thank you We'll see you next Sunday, panel.Up next, the CIA opens its doors for a rare glimpse inside. We'll take a look at items from some of the agency's most top secret missions.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)BREAM: The Central Intelligence Agency is marking 75 years by opening up, well, just a little bit. But, for one day only, reporters were allowed into its newly renovated museum to hear the stories behind the CIA's most prized possessions.Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin, who has covered these stories from the outside, now takes us inside.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)JENNIFER GRIFFIN, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice over): At CIA headquarters, you don't need a clearance to see its new renovated museum.JANELLE NEISES, CIA MUSEUM DEPUTY DIRECTOR: It's pretty much unlike anything you'll see anywhere else.GRIFFIN: Filled with declassified gadgets, like this powder compact with coded messages embedded in its mirror. A dragonfly that served as the first UAV, or drone. Or this pipe.NEISES: The idea here is that you would bite down on the pipe, and it would be able to send signals through your cavity right through here.GRIFFIN: Janelle Neises is the deputy director of the new CIA museum.NEISES: These artifacts have actually never been on display before here at CIA Museum. They're related to our ARGO mission.UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I need you to help me make a fake movie.GRIFFIN: The covert extraction on which the 2012 Ben Affleck movie was based. Six Americans rescued in Tehran, one of the agency's most daring missions.NEISES: So, we actually had a studio set up in L.A., Studio 6. We went so far as to have a script reading and invite the press. This artwork is one of my favorite artifacts in the whole museum, and it was done by Jack Kirby of the Marvel Universe.GRIFFIN: Jack Kirby had no idea he was working for the CIA when he drew it.NEISES: It's very possible that until ARGO got declassified that he had no idea.GRIFFIN: There are newly declassified items from Project Azorian, the famous Glomar mission which used millionaire Howard Hughes' drilling company as a cover to recover a sunken K-129 Russian sub.NEISES: CIA engineers had to create a capture vessel to actually go to the bottom of the ocean, 11 and a half Empire State Buildings down, grab a multi ton sub and then bring it back up.GRIFFIN: There are examples of real life dead drops, like this crumbled milk carton.NEISES: We want to make it so that it is something that blends in with its surrounding or is disgusting and no one would ever pick up.GRIFFIN: Like this rat.NEISES: We would treat the rat, hollow it out, you could put a camera in there, a micro dot reader, money, film, you sew it up and place it and then you could come pick it up. Problem during testing though was cats started stealing our dead drops.And you would rub it with either tobacco sauce or wormwood oil, anything that was an animal deterrent.GRIFFIN: There is a section devoted to post 9/11 operations.NEISES: This is the actual model that was used to brief President Biden on the Zawahiri mission.This case honors our first teams into Afghanistan after 9/11. So, our first team was in country 15 days after the attacks.GRIFFIN: These stars, like the 139 currently on the memorial wall at Langley, hung at the CIA basin in Afghanistan to honor the seven officers hunting bin Laden, killed by a suicide bomber in Chost (ph).NEISES: When we left Afghanistan, we made sure to bring this memorial back with us.GRIFFIN: Nick Reynolds, author of \"Need to Know,\" was the CIA Museum's historian until 2013.NICHOLAS REYNOLDS, AUTHOR AND FORMER CIA HISTORIAN: I like the outlier. I like the people who stood up for themselves, didn't necessarily have the stamp of approval of the establishment.GRIFFIN: World War II spies, like Virginia Hall, shown here receiving the intelligence cross at a secret White House ceremony from the first head of the OSS. Her amputated leg cost her a job at the State Department, so she volunteered to drive an ambulance in France, eventually running 1,500 French resistance forces, becoming the first paramilitary officer the CIA hired in 1947.NEISES: She lasted, in France, behind enemy lines, running assets and agents, she was getting downed pilots back out of the country and back into the U.K. She got people out of prison who were very important to the resistance without a single shot being fired.GRIFFIN: For Janelle Neises, her favorite piece in the exhibit are these boots, worn by an actual CIA officer, Dave, the teammate of Medal of Honor recipient, Mike Span, the first U.S. casualty on the ground in Afghanistan killed during a prison riot in Mazar-i-Sharif.NEISES: While getting to Mike, he completely ran out of ammunition. He was firing to get to Mike to try to save him. He took Mike's weapon, used it to get to safety.GRIFFIN: Dave's seven-year-old son started calling them daddy's lucky boots, realizing for the first time just how dangerous his dad's job was, not knowing where his father really worked.NEISES: I really think they talk about the silent sacrifice this organization makes on a daily basis. We're very small. We're very agile. We're very good with very little.(END VIDEOTAPE)GRIFFIN: And we are proud to honor that sacrifice which often goes unrecognized.That was Jennifer Griffin reporting from the CIA's Langley headquarters.And now this programming note. You can join my colleague, Dana Perino, tonight for a deep dive into November's midterms. It's called \"The Big Midterms Show.\" Dana will bring in a high-powered roundtable for a conversation about the issues and how the candidates are aiming to drive turnout.

        "text": "Games\nGovernment workers staged rallies in D.C. and beyond as political leaders are at a stalemate over how to reopen the government amid an almost three week-long partial shutdown. Democratic senators and union leaders led federal workers in rallies at the White House\u00a0and across the country on Thursday, just one day before\u00a0the partial government shutdown over border wall funding threatens to deny all of them their first full paycheck. As President Trump visited the southern border in McAllen, Texas, and declared that he will \"almost definitely\" use his emergency powers to build the wall if talks\u00a0remain stalled, the demonstrations\u00a0emphasized the financial strain imposed on government employees since the shutdown began Dec. 22. Roughly 420,000 employees were deemed essential and are working unpaid. An additional 380,000 are staying home without pay.\u00a0On Thursday afternon, after assurances from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that President Trump will sign the bill, the Senate passed legislation to provide back pay for federal workers furloughed during the ongoing\u00a0government shut down. Statistics provided by the Department of Labor showed that 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of December,\u00a0an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before. \"Shutting down the government is not a policy that should be followed,\" House majority leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told a boisterous crowd of protesters in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. Some near the White House\u00a0chanted, \"Do your jobs, so we can do ours.\" Union members and other federal employees stop in front of the White House in Washington during a rally to call for an end to the partial government shutdown, Thursday, Jan. 10, 2019. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)  \"Ladies and gentlemen, we need to keep yelling and screaming and hollering until this president opens up that government --\u00a0of the people, for the people and by the people,\" Hoyer continued. Also speaking at the rally, Democratic Virginia Sen. Mark Warner accused Trump of using federal workers as \"pawns.\" Protesters initially gathered near the\u00a0AFL-CIO building in Washington, where union leaders placed the blame squarely on Republicans. \"Let's call this shutdown what it is: It's a lockout,\" AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka shouted. \"Shame on the Senate. Shame on the White House. This lockout has to end, and it has to end now.\" Two large unions representing federal workers -- the\u00a0American Federation of Government Employees and the\u00a0National Treasury Employees Union -- have\u00a0argued it is illegal to force workers to show up to their jobs without pay. Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who delivered his own rebuttal to Trump's Tuesday night address from the Oval Office, also rallied attendees on Thursday. Sanders has consistently accused the White House of manufacturing a crisis, and has argued that climate change and health care are more urgent concerns than illegal immigration. \"Today we say to this president, \u2018Grow up, do your job, end this shutdown,\u2019\u201d Sanders said. Maryland Democratic Sens. Benjamin Cardin and Chris Van Hollen also spoke to the crowd, as did\u00a0Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal. Other rallies were taking place in Atlanta,\u00a0Denver\u00a0and Ogden, Utah, where some 5,000 IRS workers are affected by the shutdown, according to KUER NPR Utah. A local food bank reported that 50 percent more families have showed up this week than the last. Democrats have increasingly sought to make federal workers the face of the shutdown in recent days, amid reports that hundreds of unpaid Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials are calling out sick at airports. WATCH: AIRPORTS REPORT LONGER SECURITY LINES AS TSA AGENTS CALL OUT SICK \"He thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money,\" House speaker Nancy Pelosi said after a contentious meeting at the White House on Wednesday. \"But they can\u2019t.\" (Trump walked out of the meeting after Pelosi flatly refused to consider any spending bill that included wall funding.) On the 20th day of a partial government shutdown, federal employees rally at the Capitol to protest the impasse between Congress and President Donald Trump over his demand to fund a U.S.-Mexico border wall, in Washington, Thursday, Jan. 10, 2019. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)  Although Trump has said that \"most of the people not getting paid are Democrats,\" he has also sounded notes of empathy during the shutdown. \"I can relate,\" Trump\u00a0told\u00a0reporters this weekend. \"And I\u2019m sure that the people that are on the receiving end will make adjustments. They always do. And they\u2019ll make adjustments. People understand exactly what\u2019s going on. Many of those people that won\u2019t be receiving a paycheck, many of those people agree 100 percent with what I\u2019m doing.\" \u201cThere is not gonna be any bend right here,\" Trump added. The shutdown, which enters its 21st day Friday, will be the longest in history by this weekend.\u00a0Most of the government workers received their last paycheck two weeks ago. President Trump says he has absolute right to declare national emergency; chief White House correspondent John Roberts reports. TRUMP AGAIN ASSERTS POWER TO DECLARE NATIONAL EMERGENCY DURING BORDER VISIT Some workers are relying on donations, including launching GoFundMe campaigns. A food pantry has opened up at a Coast Guard base in Boston. Gabrielle Roesch, who identified herself a government scientist, wrote on Twitter: \"Applied for unemployment....even though I have a job... surreal.\" Essential government workers, like TSA agents, have been required to show up to work without pay, and have little basis for an unemployment claim, analysts said. While furloughed workers and government contractors may have stronger unemployment claims, they would likely have to return the money if Congress approves back pay to furloughed workers\u00a0once the shutdown ends, as it has done with\u00a0previous shutdowns. However, many government offices that process unemployment claims are understaffed, creating another headache for furloughed workers and contractors running low on funds. House Majority Leader Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., center on stage, gestures while speaking to union members and other federal employees at a rally to call for an end to the partial government shutdown, Thursday, Jan. 10, 2019, at AFL-CIO Headquarters in Washington. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)  CNN REPORTER JIM ACOSTA INADVERTENTLY MAKES CASE FOR BUILDING STEEL SLATS AT BORDER\u00a0 Theodore Atkinson, a furloughed trial attorney in the Justice Department's civil division, told The Associated Press\u00a0he is spending \"extraordinarily stressful\" days anxiously watching the news at his home in Baltimore. He was told to stay home during the last government shutdown in 2013. But this time, he had little time to prepare for a missed paycheck or tie up loose ends with the cases he is working on, he said. With two children and a mortgage, child support and alimony payments, Atkinson said he has taken out a personal loan to cover two paychecks, just to be safe. But if the shutdown stretches into February, he may need to take out another. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., speaks at an Air Traffic and pilot unions protest against the government shutdown on Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Jan. 10, 2019. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)  \"It's all uncertain and I don't know how it ends or resolves itself,\" he said. \"This isn't a matter of me not going to the movies or out to eat as much. I can't cut off my power or my cellphone or move out of my house.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Negotiations to end the shutdown stalled on Thursday, as Trump, during his visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas, argued a barrier made of steel would deter\u00a0human trafficking and other violent crimes. Trump, accompanied by elected officials and border agents, highlighted gun, trafficking and drug crimes along the border during remarks at a patrol station in McAllen. The president spoke in front of a table of items border agents have seized, including a\u00a0rifle, handguns, a plastic bag full of cash and bricks of heroin and methamphetamine. \u201cIf we had a barrier of any kind, a powerful barrier, whether it\u2019s steel or concrete ... we would stop it cold,\u201d Trump said of human trafficking. The president then took part in a briefing by\u00a0border agents. Back in Washington, Democrats on Thursday were blocked in the Senate after trying to proceed with House-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border wall money. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, blocked that effort, saying it amounts to \u201cpointless show votes.\u201d Fox News' Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

        "text": "Games\nFire crews responded to an explosion at Southfork Dairy Farm in Dimmitt, Texas, on Monday night. (KFDA) The explosion that killed at least 18,000 cattle at a dairy farm in Dimmitt, Texas, earlier this week is the deadliest barn fire involving cattle ever, according to a nonprofit organization. The Animal Welfare Institute (AWI) told Fox News Digital in a statement via email that the incident at Southfork Dairy Farm on Monday night is \"by far the deadliest barn fire for cattle overall and the most devastating barn fire in Texas since we began tracking barn fires in 2013.\" \"We hope the industry will remain focused on this issue and strongly encourage farms to adopt commonsense fire safety measures,\" said Allie Granger, policy associate for AWI's farm animal program. \"It is hard to imagine anything worse than being burned alive.\" Nearly 6.5 million farm animals have died in\u00a0barn fires\u00a0since 2013, according to an AWI report.\u00a0The report said that in 2021 alone, 681,825 farm animals were killed in barn fires.\u00a0 INDIANA RECYCLING PLANT CITED BEFORE MASSIVE FIRE CAUSED EVACUATION ORDERS, CANCELED SCHOOL The cause of the blast and ensuing fire is under investigation. (Castro County Sheriff's Office) Farm animals are often packed into barns, limiting the opportunity to escape during an emergency and contributing to the high number of animal fatalities during barn fires, the nonprofit\u2019s report said. The Castro County Sheriff\u2019s Office previously confirmed with Fox Digital that the cows were in a holding area before being brought in for milking when the blast occurred. At least 18,000 cattle were killed in an explosion and fire at Southfork Dairy Farm in Dimmitt, Texas, authorities said. (Castro County Sheriff's Office) Castro County Sheriff Sal Rivera told KFDA that while some cows did survive, others \"are probably injured to the point where they\u2019ll have to be destroyed.\" While the cause of the fire is still under investigation, Rivera told the station it is likely that a vacuum that sucks in manure and blows out water may have gotten overheated and caused methane and other properties to ignite. A woman was critically injured in the blast at Southfork Dairy Farm, the Castro County Sheriff's Office said. No update on her condition was immediately available. (Castro County Sheriff's Office) The AWI analysis said that of the 539 total barn fires between 2018 and 2021, the cause or likely cause was reported in just 179 cases \u2014 or about 33%. In many of the remaining cases, the destruction was too severe to determine a cause, and, in some cases, the cause remains under investigation. SUIT ALLEGES GAS LEAK AT PENNSYLVANIA CHOCOLATE FACTORY WENT IGNORED BEFORE EXPLOSION In those 179 cases, the report stated that nearly two-thirds of the barn fires involved electrical heating devices or other electrical malfunctions. Some of the deadliest barn fires recorded occurred at a facility in Bloomfield, Nebraska, in which 400,000 chickens were killed in 2020, and another in Waseca County, Minnesota, where 12,000 pigs died in 2021, according to the report.

WALES, Maine \u2014 Animal welfare officials have seized more than 60 cats from a woman who was subject of a seizure of her cats three years ago. Animal welfare agents, who counted 63 live cats and 31 dead cats, described horrific conditions in the home in Wales, WGME-TV reported. They were at the home on Wednesday. Concern over the cats\u2019 care drove the state to take away 83 cats and kittens in November 2019. But a judge ultimately ruled that most of the cats should be returned and that the owner didn't violate \"permissible standards of care.\" A cat lies in the sun on a backyard patio (iStock) This time, a Department of Health and Human Services worker reported the conditions after visiting the house, WGME-TV reported. Liam Hughes, director of animal welfare for the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, said most of the cats that were seized Wednesday had respiratory issues, ear and eye infections. He urged anyone overwhelmed or having trouble caring for animals to reach out to a local shelter or animal control officer. \"They can help tie you into resources to help reduce the problems that you\u2019re seeing,\" Hughes said.

The administration has promised a mass deportation operation, as well as increased border security. Officials have said they intend to target those with criminal histories and convictions, but have also stressed that they will potentially arrest anyone in the U.S. illegally.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A Wisconsin judge on Monday ruled that two Republican-backed measures can appear on the April ballot over the objections of criminal justice advocates who said elections officials had missed the state deadline. One of the measures would add an amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution that would make it harder for people accused of violent crimes to get out of jail on bail. The other is a non-binding advisory referendum that asks voters if they believe that able-bodied, childless welfare recipients should be required to look for work. Dane County Circuit Judge Rhonda Lanford said the groups bringing the lawsuit had not met legal requirements for a court to intervene. If the decision is not overturned by a higher court, the ballot measures will go before voters on April 4. WISCONSIN ACTIVISTS SUE TO KEEP BAIL CRACKDOWN, WELFARE WORK REQUIREMENTS OFF PRIMARY BALLOT Dan Lenz, an attorney for the groups that sued, said he was discussing next steps with his clients. He did not comment on the content of the ruling or say whether the groups will appeal. The Republican-controlled Legislature hurried to approve the measures last month in what Democrats criticized as a ploy to boost conservative turnout for a pivotal state Supreme Court race. The April election will determine ideological control of Wisconsin's highest court, which could have the final say on lawsuits challenging the state's abortion ban and legislative maps that favor Republicans. State law requires ballot questions to be \"filed with the official or agency responsible for preparing the ballots\" at least 70 days before the election, making the deadline Jan. 25. The Legislature sent the measures to the Wisconsin Election Commission on Jan. 19, but the commission did not file the measures with county election officials until Jan. 26. A Wisconsin judge has ruled that two Republican-backed measures can appear on the April ballot.  WISDOM, a faith-based statewide organizing group, and its affiliate, EXPO Wisconsin, which stands for Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing, argued that county election officials are responsible for preparing ballots, not the election commission, and therefore the ballot questions were filed past the 70-day deadline. Both groups fight against mass incarceration and work with people who have spent time behind bars. The commission said in a memo to clerks on Jan. 26 that it is the only entity where statewide ballot measures can be registered. Riley Vetterkind, a spokesperson for the commission, declined to comment on Monday's ruling. David Liners, WISDOM's executive director, said in a hearing that the group would lose time to organize voters against the bail amendment if the court did not block the ballot measures. The criminal justice groups asked that the measures be delayed until the next statewide election, which will likely be in April 2024. WISCONSIN BAIL AMENDMENT HEADED TO BALLOT BOX IN APRIL Lanford ruled that WISDOM and EXPO had failed to prove they would suffer \"irreparable harm\" \u2014 one of four criteria required for the court to block the measures. She also ruled the groups did not prove their case was likely to succeed on its merits or maintain the status quo for election administration. The criminal justice groups are represented by attorneys from Law Forward and the Stafford Rosenbaum law firms, both of which have challenged a number of Republican-authored laws in recent years. Republicans have worked for years to enact the bail amendment. The Legislature approved it last year and again this year with bipartisan support. Constitutional amendments must pass the Legislature in two consecutive sessions before being put on the ballot. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Under the amendment, judges would be allowed to consider a defendant's risk to public safety, including their criminal history, when setting bail. Currently, cash bail is set only as a means to ensure a defendant appears in court. Democratic opponents have argued the amendment could create further inequity in the criminal justice system by allowing wealthy defendants to more easily get out of jail.

Missouri law enforcement officials arrested two men after discovering seven children between the ages of 2 to 13 and several adults in the back of a U-Haul box truck during a traffic stop on the interstate, according to reports. KY3, a local NBC station out of Springfield, Missouri, reported that 31-year-old Shaikiem Bristol and 22-year-old Musa Omar were charged with seven counts of first-degree endangering the welfare of a child. The station reported that, according to court documents, a trooper with the Missouri State Highway Patrol stopped a U-Haul box truck at about 4:30 p.m. on Sunday on Interstate 44. Bristol allegedly told the trooper he and Omar rented a U-Haul box truck in Buffalo, New York, and drove down to Glendale, Arizona, to pick up a woman who had been kicked out of her house by her mother. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ACCUSED IN MISSOURI POLICE OFFICER'S DEATH HAS PRIOR RAP SHEET Shaikiem Bristol and Musa Omar were allegedly driving a U-Haul box truck from Arizona to New York with seven children in the back. (Webster County Sheriffs Office) When Bristol and Omar were pulled over, Bristol explained to the trooper that they were on their way back up to New York from Arizona. Two women were in the passenger seat, and Bristol said they were his sister and fianc\u00e9. The women told police a different story \u2014 that they traveled to Arizona to pick up some things and visit family. In the court documents, the trooper noted there were conflicting stories being told by the suspects about the trip, leading the trooper to believe they were involved in criminal activity. ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT BROTHERS ARRESTED IN MISSOURI IN CONNECTION WITH DEADLY CARJACKINGS Two men were arrested in Missouri after police reportedly discovered 7 children in the back of a U-Haul box truck.

The trooper called for backup and placed the women and Bristol under arrest. To prevent anyone from running into traffic on the interstate, police transported the U-Haul to the Webster County Jail for further investigation. During the investigation, troopers opened the back of the truck and noticed the air was warm and there was no power or air conditioning. Troopers also said there were clothes and food containers in the back, and most of the children removed from the U-Haul had dirty diapers that had not been changed for hours, police alleged.

When questioned by troopers, Bristol allegedly said he did not know why they took the kids on the trip, knowing it was going to be hot. \"That\u2019s why we tried to stop a lot,\" Bristol told police. He explained that he and Omar tried to stop every hour and a half to two hours during the trip, so the occupants in the back would not get hot. The two men also reportedly shared driving responsibilities, police said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Family Services also responded to the scene.

Police in New Mexico said a 13-year-old boy has been charged with murder, took an 11-year-old into custody and are searching for a 15-year-old boy in connection with the deadly hit-and-run of a bicyclist that was recorded on video from inside a stolen car and circulated on social media. Albuquerque police said the 13-year-old and 15-year-old have both been charged with an open count of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, leaving the scene of an accident involving great bodily harm or death and unlawful possession of a handgun by a person. Authorities believe the 13-year-old was the driver of the car that killed 63-year-old physicist Scott Dwight Habermehl, who was fatally struck at around 4:40 a.m. on May 29, 2024, as he was biking to his job at Sandia National Laboratories.\u00a0 TEEN DRIVER APPEARS TO INTENTIONALLY HIT, KILL RETIRED POLICE CHIEF IN VIRAL VIDEO The Albuquerque Police Department headquarters is seen, Feb. 2, 2024, in Albuquerque, N.M. Two teens have been charged in the death of a bicyclist.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Susan Montoya Bryan, File) The 15-year-old and an 11-year-old boy, who is too young to be charged with murder, are believed to have been passengers in car, police said.\u00a0 \"The boys videotaped the crash from inside the car as the driver swerved from the southbound lane on Moon St. onto a dedicated bike lane and struck Habermehl,\" a Monday police statement said. The kids in the car saw the flashing light on the bicycle and audio of the recording indicated they planned to hit the bicyclist.\" Video of the crash was recorded from inside the car and circulated on social media. Detectives received a tip about the video being posted to social media. A middle school principal also reported to Albuquerque Public Schools police that a student reported the same video of the crash. In the recording, a voice believed to be the 13-year-old driver is heard saying that he was about to hit the bicyclist before accelerating the car, authorities said. He is then heard saying, \"Just bump him, brash,\" police said.\u00a0 TEEN BRAGS HE'LL GET \u2018SLAP ON THE WRIST\u2019 FOR KILLING EX-POLICE CHIEF IN HIT-AND-RUN Scott Dwight Habermehl, 63, was killed in 2024 when he was struck by a stolen vehicle being driven by a teen boy while he was bicycling to work, police said.\u00a0  \"Like bump him?\" the driver asks.\u00a0 \"Yeah, just bump him.

A little over a week after the fatal crash, police had arrested him on an unrelated felony warrant, according to law enforcement.

        "text": "Games\nChad Pergram reports from Capitol Hill. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said\u00a0Tuesday that he could support\u00a0extending the extra $600-a-week unemployment benefit\u00a0in the next coronavirus relief package -- so long as President Trump backs the measure. Democratic leaders and White House officials are trying to finalize another round of emergency aid this week and hold a vote in Congress next week. If the negotiators, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, cut\u00a0a deal that includes $600 jobless aid, McConnell said he would support it. TRUMP THREATENS TO TAKE EXECUTIVE ACTION IF DEAL ON CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS BILL NOT REACHED SOON \"Wherever this thing settles between the president of the United States and his team that has to sign it into law, and the Democrats, a not-insignificant-minority in the Senate and majority in the House, is something I'm prepared to support,\" McConnell told reporters during his weekly press conference. \"Even if I have some problems with certain parts of it.\" Both parties are under growing pressure to reach a deal days after several\u00a0CARES Act\u00a0provisions, including an eviction moratorium and supplement unemployment aid,\u00a0expired, dealing a major financial blow to the millions of Americans who lost their\u00a0jobs\u00a0during the\u00a0pandemic. One major point of contention during negotiations has been whether or not to continue boosting unemployment benefits by $600 a week. Democrats have maintained the sweetened benefits need to be extended through the end of the year and have made it a key sticking point; Republicans have argued that it disincentivizes Americans from returning to their jobs, and have instead proposed a $200-a-week replacement. CALCULATE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'D RECEIVE FROM THE SECOND STIMULUS CHECK HERE Adding to the urgency is the Labor Department's July jobs report, slated to be released Friday. The unemployment figures will shed light on whether\u00a0a fresh round of business closures amid a spike in COVID-19 cases is dampening the nation's economic and jobs market recovery. Republicans arrived at the negotiating table hobbled by party infighting, with some conservatives voicing concern about the nation's ballooning deficit, which is expected to hit $3.7 trillion in 2020, a record high, according to the Congressional Budget Office. McConnell noted that many Republicans would likely not vote for the final stimulus legislation if it restores the unemployment aid. NEARLY HALF OF US JOBS LOST TO CORONAVIRUS COULD BE GONE PERMANENTLY, POLL FINDS \"We know this is going to be a negotiated settlement,\" McConnell said. \"It's not going to produce a kumbaya moment like we had back in March and April where everybody voted aye. But the American people, in the end, need help.\" Last week, Trump appeared to\u00a0endorse\u00a0continuing the $600 checks, tweeting that he was \"disappointed\"\u00a0Schumer had blocked a Republican proposal to temporarily extend the aid. About\u00a0two-thirds of workers on unemployment received\u00a0more government aid than what they earned at their old job, according to a\u00a0paper\u00a0written by economists at the University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute.

Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., touted his recently introduced No VA Resources for Illegal Aliens Act that would ban VA resources from being used to process illegal immigrant medical care claims. The state of New York has been giving cash payments to thousands of migrants who typically would not qualify for the state's welfare program. Democratic New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's administration quietly changed the state's \"Safety Net Assistance\" program eligibility rules in May to allow non-citizens who have pending applications for asylum to receive benefits, making thousands of migrants eligible for the payments, according to a report from the New York Post and confirmed by Fox News Digital. The move was made through the state's Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, which sent a message to social services agencies in the state, the report notes, though the agency would not say how many migrants are currently receiving payments. INFLUX OF ILLEGAL CHINESE MIGRANTS THREATENS US TERRITORY, ISLAND MUST SHOW 'STRENGTH OF THE NATION' New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (AP Photo/Hans Pennink, File) Reached for comment by Fox News Digital, an OTDA spokesperson said just a \"small portion\" of the $4.3 billion the governor set aside for the migrant crisis has been used for the payments, estimating that about 90% of the current migrant population in the state would not be eligible for the benefits under the new rules. \"At the request of New York City, OTDA made a technical update to allow a small percentage of migrants to receive certain additional support in compliance with state and federal law,\" the spokesperson said. But the report notes that over 173,000 migrants have made their way to New York City alone since 2022, meaning that if 10% of them were receiving payments it would amount to about 17,000 recipients in the city alone.

(Selcuk Acar/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) MAYORS WANT WORK PERMITS EXTENDED TO KEEP MIGRANTS EMPLOYED, RECEIVE NEW ASYLUM SEEKERS Migrants only qualify for the payments if they completed their paperwork to apply for asylum status and can only use the checks, which total hundreds of dollars per month, to pay for rent, utilities, clothing or other necessities, according to the report. Michael Kracker, the chairman of the Eire County Republican Committee, told Fox News Digital the payments are \"deeply offensive to hard-working New Yorkers, many who are struggling.\" Kracker pointed out that some of those who are struggling are homeless veterans, who, he argued, \"are looking for help from their state.\" \"Their state is choosing instead to provide assistance to these individuals, many of whom are ultimately going to be found to be in this country illegal,\" Kracker said. The revelations of the payments were slammed by Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., who argued they served as \"another way to attract migrants\" to New York while lower- and middle-class natives of the city struggle to make ends meet. \"You have people from all over the world coming to New York to take advantage of all these left-wing programs the governor, the mayor are implementing, while at the same time, they\u2019re clobbering taxpayers over the head,\" Malliotakis told the New York Post.

Idaho prosecutors have revealed a selfie photo of Bryan Kohberger giving the camera a thumbs up just hours after they allege he went into a house and stabbed four college students to death in a home invasion massacre that rocked the country. \"The State intends to introduce a photograph of Bryan Kohberger taken from his phone on November 13, 2022, only hours after the homicides at 10:31 a.m.,\" Latah County Deputy Prosecutor Ashley Jennings wrote in a court filing revealed Wednesday evening. \"Whether or not Bryan Kohberger can be described as having \u2018bushy eyebrows\u2019 is a factual determination to be decided by the jury.\" The photo shows Kohberger wearing earphones and giving a thumbs up in front of a shower. It would have been taken roughly an hour after police allege his phone pinged a cell tower near the crime scene following the quadruple stabbing inside. BRYAN KOHBERGER ASKS JUDGE TO BLOCK \u2018BUSHY\u2019 BROWS EVIDENCE, SUGGESTS WITNESS' ARTWORK SKEWS MEMORY Prosecutors allege Bryan Kohberger took this selfie photo at 10:31 a.m. on November 13, 2022 \u2013 about 6 hours after the murders of four University of Idaho students he is accused of committing. (Ada County Court) Kohberger's defense team asked Judge Steven Hippler to block a surviving roommate from testifying about the intruder she saw having \"bushy eyebrows\" on the night three of her housemates and another friend were killed in a 4 a.m. massacre. In the motion, attorney Elisa Massoth denied that Kohberger has bushy eyebrows to begin with. The surviving roommate, identified only as \"DM\" in court documents, is the only known witness to have encountered the intruder and lived to tell her tale after she froze in shock when he came within just three feet of her. He walked away, toward a back sliding door, and is believed to have left the house, according to court filings.

        "text": "Games\nFox News' Bill Melugin reports the latest on the migrant surge at the California border. Social media is proving to be an essential tool for human smugglers illegally transporting migrants across the southern border; and the cash-hungry traffickers aren\u2019t afraid to boast about their illegal operations, often flaunting their cash on apps and bragging about the ease at which they can evade authorities. In August, 22 people were indicted in Arizona for recruiting truck drivers using Snapchat posts of cash glamorizing illegal migrant smuggling. Many of the posts claimed drivers can make hefty sums of money without the risk of being arrested. In September, an Arizona man was sentenced to 71 months in prison for transporting hundreds of illegal immigrants, and investigators found Snapchat posts in which he gloated about cramming people into overcrowded vehicles in unsafe conditions. He also used minors to facilitate certain smuggling operations. ILLEGAL MIGRANT WHO WENT TIKTOK VIRAL URGING OTHERS TO SQUAT IN PEOPLE'S HOMES ARRESTED BY ICE This Snapchat post by Nathanael Alley Rivera, 23, of Eloy, Arizona, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges for transporting hundreds of illegal immigrants for financial gain, shows two guns and wads of cash. (Homeland Security Investigations) A New York Post investigation this month found that migrant smugglers are using Telegram to advertise their services to migrants in Turkey, and migrants from the country have been pouring into the U.S. in record numbers. Turks are being offered routes from Cancun to Tijuana in Mexico, which include flights and travel into the U.S. The smugglers reportedly tell migrants not to \"delay your dreams\" in advertisements for the travel routes. According to a segment on \"60 Minutes,\" some Chinese migrants have purportedly been using videos on the China-owned social media platform TikTok to learn \"step-by-step instructions\" for\u00a0how to find gaps in the border wall\u00a0and hire smugglers. Venezuelan illegal migrant Leonel Moreno had built up a substantial following on TikTok, where he went viral for encouraging others to cross the U.S.-Mexican border and boasted about gaming the U.S. welfare system and advising people to squat in American homes. Messenger applications, particularly WhatsApp, have also become invaluable for smugglers to communicate with migrants using the platform\u2019s free phone and video calls as well as its free text and video messaging features. Its real-time geolocation technology also facilitates journey planning, and migrants only need a Wi-Fi connection to use the app. Tom Homan, a former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said social media companies need to do more to stop smugglers from using their apps for illegal migrant crossings; social media companies say they are doing all they can to prevent it and have strict rules in place. \"Some of these Mexican cartels, they're like Fortune 500 companies. They are operating in about 40 countries around the world, especially the drug cartels, and they\u2019re using the latest technology that's available to them,\" Homan told Fox News Digital. \"They have access to drones, military-grade weapons, and they're using social media to hire U.S. citizens and others to smuggle aliens for them.\" 'NO BACKGROUND CHECK': REPORTS SAY SMUGGLERS USE SOCIAL MEDIA TO LURE TURKISH MIGRANTS TO EASY ENTRY INTO US A Snapchat post by a migrant smuggler in Arizona shows bundles of $100 bills. (United States Attorney\u2019s Office, District of Arizona) Homan said the social media companies need to clamp down on smugglers, alleging that he previously had his social media accounts restricted for posting political content. \"How come these platforms aren\u2019t monitoring this, which is criminal activity? This isn't an opinion-based thing, this is criminal,\" Homan said. \"Smuggling illegal aliens into a country and transporting them within the country is a felony. Social media needs to step up and shut this stuff down.\" A conviction for conspiring to transport illegal aliens for profit carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000, according to the U.S. District Attorney\u2019s Office in Arizona. In fiscal 2023, Customs and Border Patrol encountered 2,475,669 persons attempting entry along the Southwest border \u2013 an all-time record representing a 4.07% increase compared to the year before. However, it\u2019s unclear how many migrants or their smugglers used social media to help them along the way. \"When someone goes down to pick up four or five people, do they know they are carrying fentanyl?\" Homan said of the smugglers. \"Do they know if they're victims of trafficking? Are there women there that, as soon as they get to their final destination, will be forced into the sex trade, or if there are children, will they be forced into labor?\" Homan cited a report earlier this year by the HHS Office of Inspector General that found the agency had been unable to make contact with more than 85,000 unaccompanied child migrants who had been released to sponsors after being encountered at the\u00a0southern border. TURKISH MIGRANT CROSSING US BORDER SAYS AMERICANS ARE \u2018RIGHT\u2019 TO BE CONCERNED: \u2018NO SECURITY\u2019 \"We've already found many of them in forced labor, in meatpacking plants. We found many of them doing forced labor on farms. We found women who had been in for sex slavery and in massage parlors and so forth. So, when social media is used to hire people to do this type of work, these people are unknowingly, possibly moving people carrying fentanyl that\u2019s killed 148,000 people. They could be moving terrorists. They don't know who they are, they're just going down, picking people up, putting them in the car and taking them someplace.\" Migrants are processed for entry by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. (Jon Michael Raasch/Fox News Digital) Representatives for Snapchat, TikTok and Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, told Fox News Digital that they have policies in place to crack down on such content and remove such content when it does appear on their platforms.\u00a0 A Snapchat spokesperson told Fox Digital the company has a \"zero-tolerance policy for human smuggling\" and takes an aggressive approach to combating it on its platform. \"We use proactive detection tools to find associated content and immediately remove it, take quick action in response to in-app reports, and work closely with law enforcement to support their investigations and strengthen our work to prevent abuse of our platform,\" the Snapchat spokesperson said. \"We encourage our community to report this type of content to law enforcement directly and through our reporting tools.\" Meanwhile, a study published\u00a0by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), a United Nations group promoting \"humane and orderly migration,\" found that digital technology has made it easier for migrant smugglers to exchange money, goods and information. The study surveyed 531 migrants in transit at the southern border, 64% of whom had access to a smartphone and the internet during their journey.

(Alejandro Cegarra/Bloomberg via Getty Images) \"In the desert, I was not allowed to contact the smuggler to avoid communications tracking,\" a migrant in transit in Mexico told IOM. \"Once I got to the town, I shared my real-time [location] with the smugglers, and they guided me via messaging apps.\"\u00a0 Homan is calling on Congress to hold hearings on the matter and wants social media representatives to testify about how they are handling the situation. \"We're talking about the safety and security of this nation. What higher cause is there to take action?\" Homan said. \"Call these people in and find out why the hell they are allowing this stuff to go on. They'll shut someone out of social media for saying something politically, but they won't shut them down on social media for engaging in criminal activity. It's just ridiculous.\" Michael Dorgan is a writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business. You can send tips to michael.dorgan@fox.com and follow him on Twitter @M_Dorgan.

FILE: from the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation shows Scott Peterson.\u00a0 (California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation via AP) Schubert said the state has paid out at least $140 million in benefits. At least 158 claims have been filed for 133 inmates on death row. Fox News has reached out to Peterson\u2019s lawyers with a request for comment. Peterson was sentenced to death in 2005 after being convicted of killing his pregnant wife, Laci Peterson, in a case that attracted national attention. The California Supreme Court overturned Peterson's death sentence in August and ordered a lower court to review his murder conviction to see if he should receive a new trial. Prosecutors would not say how much money was associated with Peterson's unemployment claim, citing an ongoing investigation. Schubert said claims were also filed in the names of multiple notorious convicted murderers, including Cary Stayner, convicted of killing four people in Yosemite National Park in 1999; and Susan Eubanks, a San Diego woman convicted of killing her four sons in 1997. SHOOTER DENIED BOND IN FATAL NEBRASKA FAST FOOD RESTAURANT ATTACK In some cases, prosecutors were tipped off by listening in on recorded phone calls from prison as inmates bragged about how they were gaming the system to collect unemployment benefits. \"Quite frankly, the inmates are mocking us,\" Schubert said. He and other prosecutors said the problem was compounded by dysfunction at the California Employment Development Department, which, unlike many other states, does not check unemployment claims against a list of prison inmates. The fraud is so widespread that prosecutors said they were forced to send a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday asking for him to personally intervene. The Democratic Governor released a statement on Tuesday acknowledging that more needed to be done, according to The Times.\u00a0 \u201cWhen we saw evidence of fraud in correctional facilities,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI directed the Employment Development Department to review its practices and to take immediate actions to prevent fraud and to hold people accountable when fraud is not prevented.\u201d El Dorado County District Attorney Vern Pierson said the governor's office has asked Mark Ghilarducci, director of the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, to intervene. Prosecutors said most cases involved people outside of prison filing benefits in the names of inmates. In Kern County, home to five state prisons, one address was used to receive benefits in the names of 16 different inmates.

        "text": "Games\nDavid Gelman, CEO of Gelman Law and a former prosecutor in New Jersey, says the defense team for Matthew Hertgen, the Princeton man accused of killing his brother on Feb. 22, should seek a mental health evaluation. The Princeton, New Jersey, man known as a star student in high school, who is now accused of killing his brother and a family cat in a \"fit of madness\" last month, appeared in court Monday afternoon as prosecutors prepare to take his case to a grand jury. Matthew Hertgen, 31, is accused of murdering his 26-year-old brother, Joseph Hertgen, in the family's Princeton apartment, allegedly with a knife and golf club. He is also charged with animal cruelty related to the death of a cat. During Monday's hearing in Mercer County Superior Court, prosecutors expressed plans to take Hertgen's case to a grand jury to seek an indictment. He has a probable cause hearing scheduled for May 9. Earlier this month, Hertgen consented to pretrial detention, meaning the prosecution didn't need to show evidence proving why he should be held in jail before his trial. PRINCETON PREPPY MURDER VICTIM RECEIVED WARNING TEXT FROM OTHER BROTHER HOUR BEFORE SLAYING Matthew Hertgen has a probable cause hearing scheduled for May 9. (Mercer County) Appearing virtually from jail, Hertgen was polite during his brief appearance, telling the judge \"good afternoon\" when asked if he could hear the proceedings and saying \"thank you\" when the judge told him to have a good day as the hearing ended. The judge referenced a cellphone and laptop that were seized and password protected, but no other evidence was discussed on Monday. Princeton police initially responded to a 911 call from Matthew on Feb. 22 around 11:16 p.m. reporting a fire and his brother's dead body at the Michelle Mews Apartments complex. Matthew Hertgen appears in a pre-trial detention hearing at Mercer County Criminal Court on Thursday, March 6, 2025, in Trenton. Hertgen is accused of killing his younger brother Joseph Hertgen in February. (Stephanie Keith for Fox News Digital) When a dispatcher asked Matthew how his brother was injured, he said, \"I\u2019m not gonna go into any more details right now,\" a probable cause statement obtained by Fox News Digital reads. When police arrived to the grisley scene that night, they found Matthew in the residence along with his brother's body, which had significant injuries to the head \u2013 including a missing eye \u00a0a\u2013s well as injuries to Joseph's chest and upper body. Police also found a cup of blood with \"blood-smeared\" utensils and a plate, the probable cause document states. PRINCETON PREPPY MURDER SUSPECT'S PARENTS ARE NO-SHOWS FOR ACCUSED KILLER SON'S COURT APPEARANCE Joseph and Matthew Hertgen's high school yearbook photos  Investigators further discovered a deceased cat on an ottoman that appeared partially burned. While interviewing Matthew, who apparently had cuts on his hands, he told police he \"went into a fit of madness\u2026 maybe like forty minutes ago.\" SAVAGE TIMELINE IN PRINCETON PREPPY MURDER COULD BOLSTER INSANITY DEFENSE FOR SUSPECT BROTHER: EXPERT The Michelle Mews housing complex in Princeton, Feb. 26, 2025. Matthew Hertgen is alleged to have murdered his brother, Joseph, inside their apartment.

PRINCETON MAN SHARED EERIE POEMS ON SOCIAL MEDIA BEFORE ALLEGEDLY KILLING FORMER STAR ATHLETE BROTHER, CAT Hertgen appeared in court on March 6 for a detention hearing, which is typically when evidence is presented by the defense and prosecutors to determine whether a defendant should be held behind bars or released, according to David Gelman, CEO of Gelman Law and a former prosecutor in New Jersey. David Hertgen, left, Debra Hertgen and David Hertgen Jr. attend the funeral for Joseph Hertgen at St. Luke Roman Catholic Church on March 1, 2025 in Toms River, New Jersey. (Stephanie Keith for Fox News Digital) However, during that hearing, no evidence was presented because Hertgen consented to pretrial detention, meaning it was not necessary for the prosecution to show evidence proving why he should be held in jail before his trial. None of Hertgen's family members were in court for that hearing. He is scheduled to return to court on March 24. A photo from the 2011 Toms River North High School yearbook shows Matthew Hertgen playing soccer for the school team. (Obtained by Fox News Digital) \"It's very disturbing. You don't see many murders like this,\" Gelman told Fox News Digital. \"You can see it's very personal.\u2026 I was a prosecutor and I dealt with a ton of murders\u2026 and as a defense attorney, I also deal with murders. And when you see these types of really gruesome, graphic, heinous crimes\u2026 I have a feeling that this individual definitely has some type of mental illness.\" PRINCETON MAN ACCUSED OF KILLING FORMER STAR ATHLETE BROTHER, CAT WITH GOLF CLUB, KNIFE NEAR IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL Gelman, who is not involved in the case, also said he would request a mental health evaluation for the suspect.

A father who\u2019d faced a series of domestic violence charges was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of his 1-year-old son in a case that renewed criticism of Maine's child welfare agency. Reginald Melvin, 30, of Milo, was sentenced Wednesday after entering a plea that had a similar consequence to a guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter. Under an agreement, prosecutors dropped a murder charge. His son, Sylus, died in August 2021 from blunt force trauma that left him with multiple internal injuries, according to the state medical examiner. Sylus' mother, Desiree Newbert, said she reported to the Department of Health and Human Services that Melvin threatened to kill the family including her, Sylus, and her daughter. But that a caseworker never returned her call or visited the family. Melvin had been previously charged multiple times with domestic violence. OPPONENTS TO NEW MAINE ABORTION LAW WON'T ATTEMPT TO NULLIFY THROUGH SO-CALLED PEOPLE'S VETO Former state Sen. Bill Diamond accused the agency of \"leaving vulnerable children in dangerous situations despite repeated warnings by family members and others that children are not safe.\" The family had six different caseworkers after Sylus' birth, and none of them compared notes with each other, Diamond said.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Richard Blodgett, a single father, was jailed on a drug charge when a worker from Arizona's child welfare agency delivered the news: His son was brain dead and on life support \u2014 just days after being taken into state custody. Blodgett screamed, cried and screamed some more. Jakob was his only son, a \"darn cute,\" curious 9-year-old who loved remote control cars and video games. Blodgett is now struggling to understand how it happened. DIABETES DRUG LED TO SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT LOSS IN PEOPLE WITH OBESITY: STUDY A medical examiner listed Jakob's death in late December as natural with complications from diabetes, a condition he was diagnosed with as a toddler. Specifically, Type 1 diabetes, which means his body was unable to produce enough insulin to survive. Blodgett said he suspects the Arizona Department of Child Safety failed in its duty to protect his son, either by not monitoring his blood sugar levels or not ensuring that Jakob had enough insulin to prevent a serious, life-threatening complication known as ketoacidosis. \"They couldn't keep him alive for two weeks, two weeks,\" the father told The Associated Press while on a recent furlough from jail. \"That's absolutely insane. That was my pride and joy. I'm lost. I'm completely lost. My family is completely lost.\" The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office is investigating Jakob's death. The office declined a request for an interview with Sheriff Paul Penzone, citing the ongoing investigation. Richard Blodgett takes a picture with his son Jakob. Jakob was placed in a foster home while the father was incarcerated. The son later died from diabetic complications. (Richard Blodgett via AP) The Department of Child Safety also declined to comment specifically on the case, citing confidentiality laws. But spokesperson Darren DaRonco said, in general, that foster parents are required to receive training from a medical provider before taking in a child with any medical condition. DaRonco did not respond to further inquiries, including whether Jakob's insulin pump was removed and if the boy's regular doctor was consulted about his care \u2014 questions raised by Blodgett and his mother, Cheryl Doenges. They said Jakob could not manage the insulin on his own. In the fiscal year that ended last June, about 26 children died while in the agency's custody, including from overdoses, medical conditions, natural and still undetermined causes. In the previous fiscal year, that number was 14. The figures amount to a fatality rate of about 97 per 100,000 children during that period, the most recent for which data is available. That rate is higher than overall deaths of children in Arizona. Nationally, about 55 children died per 100,000 children in the general population of all causes in 2020 \u2014 similar to Arizona's number. Karin Kline, director of child welfare initiatives at the Family Involvement Center in Phoenix, said the death of a child is a concern, especially if it happens under the custody of the state. \"Rest assured, somebody is going to look into it if there's an inkling that the death was a result of negligence or abuse,\" she said. OZEMPIC TRENDING AS A WEIGHT LOSS DRUG: HERE'S WHY AND WHAT DOCTORS SAY Jakob and his father had been living at a motel when Blodgett was arrested in December. Blodgett, who already had a drug case pending and has spent time in prison, said was operating a backhoe much of the day and pulled over at a gas station to take a nap. The report from the Show Low Police Department corroborated as much, but officers wrote that they suspected Blodgett nodded off as a result of drug use. Authorities ultimately found more than 4,000 fentanyl pills in Blodgett's possession, according to the report. Blodgett was booked into jail in Holbrook and charged with one count of drug possession, Navajo County Superior Court documents show. Blodgett told the AP he had been using fentanyl for pain management after he dropped 300 pounds with weight loss surgery. \"I wasn\u2019t getting high. I wasn\u2019t abusing them. I was using them to be able to work and provide for my son,\" Blodgett said. \"Unfortunately, they are illegal. I can\u2019t get around that. But they were stronger than my meds, and they were working.\" Jakob was alone in the motel room when an officer picked him up and alerted the Department of Child Safety, according to the police report. Blodgett said someone at the motel always checked on his son, whom he called as police confronted him. He told Jakob he got into trouble, and the boy asked if his father was going to be OK, Blodgett said. The two often traveled together in vast expanses of Arizona \u2014 taking selfies, stopping at gas stations to get snacks and playing with Nerf guns. \"The last time I got to see my son, he was already dead,\" Blodgett said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Doenges couldn't make the trip to see Jakob at the hospital from Washington state where she lives because of bad weather. But she asked a friend in Arizona to sit with Jakob, pray with him and play music for him so he wasn't alone \u2014 even if he didn't know she was there. Furloughed from jail, Blodgett arranged for a ride to Phoenix, more than three hours away, to see his son unresponsive in a hospital bed. Hospital staff had placed a teddy bear next to the boy and a heart-shaped pendant \u2014 Blodgett kept one half and the other half will be cremated with Jakob, Doenges said. Blodgett took pictures, hugged and kissed his son and talked to him. The hospital had a memorial for Jakob on Dec. 26 \u2014 the day some of his organs were harvested and later donated with Blodgett's blessing, along with a moment of silence. Before the year ended, Blodgett was back in jail. Doenges said her son will have to find a way to piece his life back together. \"My suggestion to him is to live a really good life in memory of Jakob and do something positive,\" she said. \"He probably didn't even hear me, he's so full of grief.\" Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox Subscribed You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92025 FOX News Network, LLC.

The Mississippi Department of Human Services is suing 38 people or companies, including retired NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Brett Favre, for misspending millions in welfare money aimed to help the poorest state in the country, according to multiple reports.\u00a0 The lawsuit, filed in Hinds County Circuit Court, aims to recover the more than $20 million in cash it claims the defendants \"squandered\" from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families anti-poverty program. \"I do not understand these people,\" attorney Brad Pigott, who wrote the lawsuit, told Mississippi Today. \"What kind of person would decide that money the law required to be spent helping the poorest people in the poorest state would be better spent being doled out by them to their own families, their own pet projects, and their own favorite\u00a0celebrities?\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The lawsuit was filed just weeks after the mother and son duo of Nancy New, 69, and Zachary New, 39, pleaded guilty to state criminal charges over the misspending. The duo agreed to testify against others in the corruption case, which auditor Shad White said was Mississippi\u2019s largest in the past two decades. They ran a nonprofit group and education company in the state, which received tens of millions of dollars under contracts with the Mississippi Department of Human Services; however, much of the money was illegally funneled to other nonprofits or contractors, considered \"second-tier\" recipients of the department, the outlet reported.\u00a0 Some of the welfare money was spent on drug rehabilitation in California for former pro wrestler Brett DiBiase. He was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, along with his father and brother, Ted DiBiase Sr. and Ted \"Teddy\" DiBiase Jr. In 2020, Nancy\u00a0and Zachary, along with former Mississippi Department of Human Services executive director John Davis and three other people, were charged in state court over the misspending.\u00a0 Last year, White demanded repayment of $77 million of misspent welfare funds, which included $1.1 million paid to Favre, who lives in Mississippi and has not been charged with any wrongdoing.\u00a0 Oct. 11, 2010: Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brett Favre reacts during the third quarter of an NFL football game against the New York Jets in East Rutherford, N.J.

Favre has stated he didn't know the money came from welfare funds and noted his charity has provided millions in cash to help children in poverty in Mississippi and Wisconsin.\u00a0 MISSISSIPPI SAYS IT AWAITS $600K REPAYMENT FROM BRETT FAVRE The lawsuit on Monday claims Favre was once the largest individual outside investor and stockholder of Florida-based company Prevacus, which was attempting to develop a concussion drug. The suit claims that in December 2018, Favre hoped Prevacus CEO Jake VanLandingham would ask Nancy to use the welfare money to invest in the company.\u00a0 In January 2019, Favre hosted a Prevacus stock sales presentation at his home that was attended by many of the defendants, where an agreement was reached to spend \"substantial\" welfare grant money on Prevacus and its corporate affiliate PreSolMD Inc. The suit claims the stock was in the names of Nancy and Zach but was also for the financial benefit of Favre, VanLandingham, and the two companies. It demands repayment of $2.1 million in welfare grant money that was improperly paid to the two companies that year.\u00a0 Brett Favre #4 of the Green Bay Packers looks to pass during the NFL Divisional Playoff Game against the San Francisco 49ers on January 4, 1997 in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

        "text": "Games\nWAUKEE, Iowa \u2013 Residents of a Des Moines suburb criticized a government agreement with Apple that gave the tech giant $200 million in public subsidies for a project that's years behind schedule. \"It\u2019s not fair. They don\u2019t give me anything,\" a Waukee man told Fox News. \"I go there as a citizen, as a single person, they\u2019re not going to listen to me.\" Apple reached an agreement with state and local officials in 2017 that gave the tech giant $213 million in public subsidies in exchange for 50 permanent jobs at a data center it would build in Waukee. Residents have criticized the agreement for lacking transparency and for its perceived unfairness.\u00a0 \"I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s right,\" a Waukee resident told Fox News. \"The small businesses in Waukee should get that type of a break and not the super huge conglomerates.\" SILICON VALLEY LOCALS ON BIG TECH CENSORSHIP: \u2018THEY'RE NOT IMPARTIAL' Apple, which reached a market value of $3 trillion in January, planned to open the data center in 2020, according to the company's initial announcement. Apple now plans to complete the project in 2027, according to the Des Moines Register. Waukee Assistant City Administrator Brad Deets described Apple as a \"great corporate partner for our community.\" He repeatedly directed Fox News to Apple for specific questions about the agreement. Apple declined to comment on how the agreement would help Waukee residents. The company also declined to comment on questions related to the deal's financial incentives, the negotiation process and promises to the city. \"We are proud to be part of the community in Waukee, and of our many contributions to the city, including contributing more than $5.5\u00a0million to local projects like the new Triumph Park,\" Apple representative Rachel Wolf Tulley told Fox News. She said the project would add hundreds of construction jobs and that the company hopes to break ground in the coming months. Apple\u2019s contributions represent about 2.6% of the subsidies it received. It had promised to donate up to $100 million to the city's public improvement fund. Apple CEO Tim Cook's 2021 compensation package of $98.7 million was larger than Waukee's entire budget last year.\u00a0 Apple CEO Tim Cook (Getty Images/iStock) The negotiations regarding the agreement are still shrouded in secrecy more than four years after the announcement. The state released the agreement's details just 90 minutes before a board meeting to approve the plans, the Des Moines Register reported. The meeting allotted 10 minutes for public comments. The 2017 agreement gave Apple a\u00a071% reduction in property taxes for 20 years, valued at $188 million, according to the Des Moines Register. The city and state also agreed to pay for the water and sewer infrastructure that the data center will require. Deets said he couldn't provide details of the financial incentives provided to Apple. \"That\u2019s really probably a question that needs to be directed toward Apple,\" Deets told Fox News. \"Apple has been that go-to person in terms of explaining those incentives.\" Apple refused to answer those questions.\u00a0 Dave Swenson,\u00a0an economic research scientist at Iowa State University, called the agreement a \"political decision.\" He told Fox News that it was a way for public officials to \"pat themselves on the back and pretend they\u2019re instrumental in economic growth.\" \"These data centers get extraordinary tax breaks,\" Swenson said. \"Tax breaks that aren\u2019t available for other types of businesses, tax breaks that don\u2019t apply to existing businesses that are already in business and paying their taxes.\" One citizen told Fox News: \"It\u2019s just welfare. Waukee probably would've been just fine without it.\" Residents also criticized the agreement, saying that 50 jobs wasn't enough to justify $200 million in public subsidies. \"For 50 people that will work in that facility \u2026 it just doesn\u2019t make any sense,\" a local hardware store employee told Fox News. Waukee residents at the Heartland Co-Op criticized the agreement.  Critics and advocates alike have pointed to Iowa's natural resources and landscape as big draws for data centers. Opponents have said subsidies are unnecessary with such inherent incentives. Iowa\u2019s energy costs, land prices, natural climate and lack of earthquakes contribute to Silicon Valley\u2019s investment in the state, according to state Sen. Joe Bolkcom.\u00a0 \"We have natural incentives in place,\" Bolkcom told Fox News. He called financial benefits \"giveaways to these super wealthy corporations.\" FUTURE OF 5G DEVELOPMENT, ROLLOUT LIES WITH WIRELESS COMPANIES, NOT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT: FORMER OFFICIAL\u00a0 Swenson said: \"The evidence suggests that roughly 70 to 75% of all public money that has been dedicated towards incentivizing businesses was unneeded and unnecessary. It did not affect the location decision at all.\"\u00a0 Iowa State University Research Scientist Dave Swenson  Swenson also said corporate subsidies harm public resources. If Apple is not \"paying its fair share of taxes \u2026 then everyone else \u2013 all things being equal \u2013 must pay more, or everyone else must satisfy themselves with fewer public goods,\" he told Fox News. Deets said the city's population has increased by 75% over the last 10 years, and Waukee Community School District Superintendent Brad Buck said he expects enrollment in local schools to increase by 24% in the next five years.\u00a0 Waukee schools had\u00a0a $70 million deficit in 2021, and Iowa accumulated nearly $800 million in debt, according to its most recent budget summary. Waukee Assistant City Administrator Brad Deets  Deets\u00a0hopes Apple's project will attract similar companies. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We always see development breeds other development, and we fully anticipate as Apple begins to build out, there will be other like-minded businesses that will locate in the city,\" he told a local CBS affiliate. Swenson said that attraction may cost Iowans. He called the subsidies a \"standing offer\" that Iowa will have to meet for future corporate agreements, suggesting that big tech companies would expect to receive at least as much public funding as Apple did to build a data center in the state. \"The hole that they\u2019ve dug, the public will never get paid back,\" Swenson said. \"This is a pure, unadulterated subsidy.\" The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. An 86-year-old Maine resident was found guilty last week of assuming his dead brother\u2019s identity, starting in the mid-1960s, and using it to obtain a second passport and double dip on Social Security benefits.\u00a0 Napoleon Gonzalez, of Etna, was convicted Friday of one count of identity theft, two counts of passport fraud, two counts of Social Security fraud and one count of mail fraud following a two-day trial before Judge John A. Woodcock, Jr. in U.S. District Court in Bangor.\u00a0 Court records say Gonzalez first took on the identity of his brother, Guillermo Gonzalez, in 1965. His brother had died as an infant in 1939. Authorities say Gonzalez used the stolen identity to obtain Social Security benefits under both identities, multiple passports, and state identification cards. FILE: In this photo illustration, a Social Security card sits alongside checks from the U.S. Treasury. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) The Social Security Administration previously investigated Gonzalez's benefits in 2010 for potential fraud and his benefits were upheld. A new investigation was launched in 2020 after facial identification software indicated Gonzalez's face was on two state identification cards. The facial recognition technology is used by the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ensure no one obtains multiple credentials, or credentials under someone else's name, said Emily Cook, spokesperson for the Secretary of State's office. \"When fraud is detected, the fraudulent transactions are investigated and referred for administrative and/or criminal proceedings. That is what happened with this case,\" she said. GEORGIA MAN ARRESTED AFTER ALLEGEDLY STEALING PORCH FROM NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTY Gonzalez has claimed he took on his deceased brother's identity at the direction of the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations while participating in an undercover operation in the 1960s, according to court documents. He later admitted to faking his death under his own identity and continued with his brother's identity, the documents indicated. Gonzalez\u2019s attorney, Harris Mattson, said Tuesday he intends to appeal and will seek to keep his client out prison until the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issues a ruling.\u00a0 Mattson said he doesn't think the government proved all the elements of the multiple counts against his client, and he questioned the wisdom of the imposition of a lengthy prison sentence for his client at his advanced age. A sentencing date has not yet been set for Gonzalez, who remains free.

The number one governmental agency impersonated is the Social Security Administration. Let's face it, there are no nine numbers more important than your social security number.\u202f It may seem like an exaggeration.\u00a0 CLICK TO GET KURT\u2019S CYBERGUY NEWSLETTER WITH QUICK TIPS, TECH REVIEWS, SECURITY ALERTS AND EASY HOW-TO\u2019S TO MAKE YOU SMARTER\u00a0 You should know that every aspect of your life is tied to your social security number: loans, college admissions, health insurance, social security benefits, taxes, and bank accounts, to name a few.\u202f If your social security number gets into the wrong hands, it can wreak havoc on your life.\u00a0 According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), there have been 95,901 total reports of government imposter scams back in 2022 alone. The number 1 governmental agency impersonated? That\u2019s right: The Social Security Administration. In 2022 alone, imposters claiming to be working for the Social Security Administration amounted to $46.37 million in total losses.\u00a0 A Social Security card is displayed in Tigard, Ore., Oct. 12, 2021. Individuals will be allowed to make sure their records with the Social Security Administration align with their gender identity under a plan announced Wednesday, Oct. 19, 2022.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Jenny Kane, File) BIDEN AND TRUMP COVERAGE - WHY LEFT AND RIGHT SOUND SIMILAR ON SOCIAL SECURITY 5 types of social security number fraud\u00a0 In almost every type of identity theft, your social security number is usually a crucial piece of information necessary to hijack your identity.\u00a0 Below are the top 5 ways fraudsters and criminals use your social security number in the different identity theft scams:\u00a0 1. Criminal identity theft:\u00a0 Criminals take your social security number as the cornerstone to establish your identity, as it is required to apply for a driver\u2019s license, ID card, or passport. When crimes are committed with the identity tied to your social security number, authorities can end up on your doorstep with a warrant for your arrest for crimes you didn\u2019t even commit!\u00a0 2. Business impersonation:\u00a0 The top pieces of personal information criminals try to squeeze out of you when impersonating businesses is your social security information. Oftentimes, criminals impersonate official government agencies such as the IRS or Social Security Administration agency to trick or scare you into disclosing your social security number or part with your hard-earned money. They can then threaten you for more money or sell your information online.\u00a0 3. Medical identity theft:\u00a0 You need your social security number to get health insurance, and if you make use of Medi-Cal, Medicare, or Medicaid, you will be required to share it to receive coverage or services. The consequences don\u2019t even involve just losing coverage or being unable to receive services. With your social security number being used in medical identity theft, a completely different person can be impacting your medical records with services rendered and prescriptions filled.\u00a0 Following an executive order from Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee, the state\u2019s Department of Licensing no longer quickly confirms identity through Social Security numbers. (AP) WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS BIDEN'S CLAIM THAT REPUBLICANS WANT TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY: 'HE PUT THEM ON DEFENSE 4. Synthetic identity theft:\u00a0 With as little information as your social security number, criminals can use it in combination with theirs to create a hybrid identity to open accounts, take out loans, and do whatever they please with this \u2018new\u2019 identity while ruining yours.\u00a0 5. Child identity fraud:\u00a0 There\u2019s something especially troubling about the latest trend to steal the social security number of children. However, due to the fact that social security numbers rarely become an active part of most people\u2019s lives until they start applying for colleges or financial loans, this type of identity theft usually goes unnoticed for years, which means more damage to undo.\u00a0 Top ways to keep your social security number safe?\u00a0 Now that you know how someone can take your social security number and use it to commit identity theft, below are key ways to keep it safe!\u00a0 BEN CARSON RIPS JAN. 6 COMMITTEE FOR LEAKING SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER OF TRUMP ALLIES: \u2018NOT AN ACCIDENT\u2019 1. Hide/safe keep your social security number card:\u00a0 Put your social security number card in a very safe place, such as a safe, bank safe, or filing cabinet that can be locked. Because it is used so frequently, those nine digits are worth memorizing. If your wallet is lost or stolen and you keep your SSN card in there, it will be messier than losing just money or your ID. Don\u2019t carry your social security card in your wallet or purse!\u00a0 2. Use an identity theft or fraud protection service\u00a0 Companies such as Identity Guard can monitor your SSN and alert you if it is sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. The faster you know, the quicker you can shut down the damage. In fact, some companies will help you freeze your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further use by criminals.\u202fFortunately, taking advantage of stellar fraud protection from our top pick, Identity Guard is even more affordable with an exclusive CyberGuy savings (up to 51% off).\u00a0 See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft by searching \u2018identity theft' at CyberGuy.com by clicking the magnifying glass icon at the top of my website. 3. Go online:\u00a0 Skip jotting down your social security number on in-person forms. When your social security number is jotted down on paper, it is hard to control how the information gets used or disposed of. If you can submit forms online, you can skip the risk of having your SSN from getting into the wrong hands. If you mail in forms that denote your SSN, you risk having that piece of mail stolen or lost.\u00a0 FILE: The IRS mistakenly posted the Social Security numbers of tens of thousands of Americans on a government website. (AP) SEN. RON JOHNSON SAYS BIDEN IS LYING ABOUT HIM, REFERENCES 1975 PROPOSAL TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE 4. Opt out of inputting SSN:\u00a0 Even though your SSN is requested on some forms, it is not always necessary. If a future employer is requesting your SSN, double-check why they need it. They would most likely need it to run a background check, which you should know about anyway. Additionally, some establishments allow you to provide the last 4-digits of your SSN until you are finalizing a screening process, etc.\u00a0 5. Sign up for a social security account:\u00a0 Go to the official Social Security Administration website to create an account. Because only one account can be created per social security number, it is safer if you claim it so no one else can by piecing together your personal information (along with your SSN) to claim it fraudulently. Make sure it is connected to a secure email account that you check frequently. This account also provides up-to-date data on earnings and benefit distributions so you can see if anything is \u2018off\u2019.\u00a0 6. Combat child identity theft:\u00a0 Open accounts for your children's SSNs because you want to claim them for them early and be able to monitor any movement related to their social security number.\u00a0 7. Secure documents:\u00a0 Some records that contain your social security number are important to keep on hand, such as income tax filings. If they are kept digitally, encrypt and or password-protect the document or folder, especially if it is uploaded to the cloud. Keep offline documents with SSNs in a safe or shred instead of throwing them away.\u00a0 Remember you (usually) only get one social security number in a lifetime, it is important to safeguard that data with your \u2018life\u2019! Tell us: How have you kept your social security number safe?\u00a0 Check out the best ways to protect yourself from identity theft\u202fby heading over to CyberGuy.com and searching \"How to protect yourself from identity theft\"\u202fby clicking the magnifying glass at the top of my website.\u00a0 How to protect yourself from identity theft\u00a0 (Cyberguy.com) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In what ways will you protect your social security number moving forward?

Michelle Lujan Grisham is making a leadership change at New Mexico's embattled foster care and child welfare agency. The governor on Thursday announced the departure of Barbara Vigil as secretary of the Children, Youth and Families Department, effective May 1, while the administration searches for a replacement. For the interim, the agency will be lead by Teresa Casados, a political appointee and top administrator to the governor's office. New Mexico\u2019s repeat rate of reported child abuse cases is among the worst in the country, amid chronic workforce shortages in the child welfare system and high turnover among employees in protective services. NEW MEXICO'S TOP PROSECUTOR WANTS TO SET UP A CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION TO HELP CHILDREN IN STATE CUSTODY The state has responded in recent years with increased investments in services aimed at preventing abuse. In February, the governor outlined new efforts to make the agency and its protective services division more responsive to the needs of children and complaints from families. She commissioned a policy advisory council that Vigil will now join for its first meeting in May. Republican state Sen. Crystal Diamond of Elephant Butte expressed frustration with the leadership change and the recent rejection of legislative proposals on child welfare. New Mexico Gov.

Grisham is making leadership changes at the state\u2019s embattled child welfare agency as\u00a0New Mexico struggles to tackle its high repeat rate of child abuse cases.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Morgan Lee) \"Legislators were bullied by the governor into rejecting viable, bipartisan solutions with the empty promise that Secretary Vigil would be a steady hand of change,\" Diamond said in a statement. \"This is truly a sad day for New Mexico.\" Vigil, a former state Supreme Court justice, took the reins of the agency in October 2021 amid New Mexico's longstanding struggle to improve childhood wellbeing. On Thursday, Lujan Grisham called Vigil a stabilizing force for the agency, where she improved relationships with staff and constituents including Native American communities. NEW MEXICO GOV. GRISHAM SIGNS BILL TO PROTECT ABORTION PROVIDERS Vigil oversaw initial implementation of the state's Indian Family Protection Act, aimed at preventing any arbitrary separation of Native American children from cultural ties to tribal communities. But frustrations with the agency and concerns about child welfare continue to run high. This year, Republican lawmakers in the legislative minority led calls for greater accountability through jilted proposals to hire a \"chief child advocate\" to investigate grievances and new standards for assessing the needs of children. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\u00a0 The governor signed a bill establishing tighter deadlines for courts to determine whether youths remain in state custody, but rejected other accountability initiatives \u2014 including a failed proposal to create a civil rights division at the attorney general's office to advocate for the rights of children. In a statement, Vigil was hopeful about prospects for improvements. \"Collaborating with child welfare professionals, we built a foundation for lasting change and positive outcomes for our children and families, she said.

(Courtesy: Jam Press)  Colombia\u2019s congress voted Tuesday to ban bullfights in the South American nation, delivering a serious blow to a centuries-old tradition that has inspired famous songs and novels but has become increasingly controversial in the countries where it is still practiced. The bill calls for the banning of bullfights in a three-year span, making the tradition illegal by the start of 2028. The new law now needs to be signed by President Gustavo Petro, who has been a longtime opponent of these events. Bullfighting originated in the Iberian Peninsula and is still legal in a handful of countries, including Spain, France, Portugal, Peru, Ecuador and Mexico. EXPEDITION TO 'HOLY GRAIL' SHIPWRECK FULL OF GOLD, EMERALDS BEGINS IN CARIBBEAN SEA It was once a popular event, broadcast live by multiple television networks. But the tradition has come under increased scrutiny as views change about animal welfare, and many find it unacceptable to see an animal suffer for entertainment's sake. Demonstrators take part in a vigil holding posters with messages that read in Spanish: \"No more culture of violence\" during a protest against bullfighting, which has been temporarily suspended as Congress debates its legality, in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, on May 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Fernando Vergara) \"This ban is a huge victory for organizations that have worked to transform society and reject violence against animals,\" said Terry Hurtado, an animal rights activist and city council member in Cali, who has been leading protests against bullfights since the 1990s. \"I feel relieved that bulls and horses (which also participate in some bullfights) in Colombia will no longer be tortured, and that children will no longer be exposed to this spectacle.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In bullfights, a matador faces bulls that are bred to be aggressive. The matador taunts the bull with a red cape and kills the animal with the blow of a sword after it has been injured with lances and daggers, and is tired of charging at the matador in a circular arena. In Colombia, where bullfights have been held since colonial times, less than two dozen municipalities continue to hold these events, although the annual bullfights in the city of Manizales still draw tens of thousands of spectators. Bullfighting aficionados described the ban as an assault on the freedoms of minorities as well as a problem for cities where these events draw thousands of visitors.

An Idaho judge has vacated Lori Vallow's murder trial, set to begin in January, pending the results of a competency evaluation, court documents released Thursday reveal. Vallow, who is accused of killing her two children and collecting their Social Security benefits in 2019, was scheduled to appear in court for a joint murder trial with her husband, Chad\u00a0Daybell, who faces the same charges as his wife. \"That this case \u2026 is hereby suspended until determination of Mrs. Daybell\u2019s competency to stand trial can be determined,\" Fremont County Judge Stephen Boyce said in a Thursday court order. \"\u2026Accordingly, the Court sees no other alternative at this time than to vacate the January 9, 2023 trial.\" Boyce previously determined Vallow to be competent to stand trial in April after she spent nine months in an Idaho mental health facility.\u00a0 IDAHO JUDGE IN LORI VALLOW, CHAD DAYBELL CASE BARS CAMERAS FROM COURTROOM: \u2018A GREAT RISK\u2019 Lori Vallow Daybell, 49, and her most recent husband, Chad Daybell, 54, are accused of killing two of Vallow's two children and collecting social security benefits in their names after their deaths. (Tony Blakeslee/East Idaho News) Vallow and Daybell are at the center of the bizarre murder case involving not only Vallow's two children but both Daybell's and Vallow's deceased ex-spouses. However, last week, Daybell filed requests to sever their cases. He initially filed a motion to separate his case from his wife's in 2021, which the court denied in March, citing three potential sources for prejudice. The murder suspect's lawyers argued that the court's reasoning was an incorrect application of Idaho law. IDAHO MURDER SUSPECT CHAD DAYBELL WANTS TRIAL DELAYED, SEVERED FROM \u2018DOOMSDAY CULT\u2019 WIFE LORI VALLOW'S His attorneys are arguing that a joint trial is unfair in this case because prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Vallow, which may result in prejudice against Daybell. Additionally, his lawyers state that the defendant will not be able to present a \"complete defense\" in a joint trial, among other conflicts. Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell are at the center of a tangled case that involves a bizarre apocalyptic religious belief that prosecutors claim the couple designed to justify the murders. (Rexburg Police Department) Daybell's counsel is also asking for his trial date to be pushed back from January 2023 \"due to the substantial amount of trial investigation and preparation and significant amount of discovery\" that they say has still not been provided to the defense by prosecutors. LORI VALLOW, CHAD DAYBELL 'DOOMSDAY' MURDERS: A TIMELINE OF EVENTS Vallow's two children, 7-year-old Joshua \"J.J.\" Vallow and 17-year-old Tylee Ryan, were killed in September 2019. Vallow and Daybell have been accused of collecting Social Security benefits with their information between Oct. 1, 2019, and Jan. 22, 2020.\u00a0 Lori and Chad Daybell are accused of killing 17-year-old Tylee Ryan and 7-year-old J.J. Vallow in 2019. (Rexberg Police Department) The children were missing for several months \u2014 police say the couple lied about the children\u2019s whereabouts and then slipped away to Hawaii \u2014 before their bodies were found buried on Daybell's property in rural Idaho. LORI VALLOW TRIAL: WRITER SAYS IDAHO JUDGE HAS ORDERED \u2018AN UNUSUAL NUMBER OF DOCUMENTS SEALED\u2019 IN CASE The couple was indicted in late May 2021 on multiple counts each of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and grand theft by deception, first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder related to the deaths of Tylee; J.J.; and Daybell's ex-wife, officials\u00a0announced at the time. Arizona officials in June 2021 also indicted Vallow in the July 2019 murder of her ex-husband, Charles Vallow. Lori Vallow smiled in and outside of an Idaho courthouse on Aug, 16. (Tony Blakeslee/East Idaho News) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The case has garnered national attention and inspired various crime television episodes and documentaries. Netflix most recently released the documentary series \"Sins of our Mother\" about Vallow and her life before the alleged crimes on Sept. 14. Daybell has written several apocalyptic novels based loosely on Mormon theology. Both were involved in a group that promotes preparedness for the biblical end times. Meanwhile, Vallow reportedly believed she was \"a god assigned to carry out the work of the 144,000 at Christ\u2019s second coming in July 2020,\" according to divorce documents that her late ex-husband, Charles Vallow, filed before his death.

Feal, a retired construction worker who lost part of his foot while working at Ground Zero in the aftermath of the attacks, founded the FealGood Foundation to benefit responders who have suffered from numerous health issues related to the fallout of the attacks.\u00a0 The organization organized numerous protests on Capitol Hill and pressured lawmakers to act, scoring a victory with the World Trade Center Health Program that Congress approved in 2015.

(REUTERS/John Roca/New York Daily News/pool) The bill pays the medical costs of first responders, many of whom have suffered from respiratory diseases, digestive disorders and cancers as a result of their exposure to toxins at the site of the Twin Towers. Others suffered life-altering injuries that require constant care and rehabilitation. Feal is again pushing for lawmakers to take action, this time on a funding shortfall in the program, which he said will be $3 billion short sometime before 2025. While the bill authorizes funding through 2090, Feal said it did not account for the cost of health care inflation, a problem he said will leave many responders unable to pay their medical bills. \"In 2015, there were 76,000 people in the World Trade Center Health Care Program. Now there's close to 118,000 people in the program,\" Feal said. \"Nobody took into consideration medical inflation.\" The additional $3 billion in funding would ensure people keep the doctors, nurses and administrators who have been working with them on the job while also making sure responders continue to receive the medications and treatments they need. Hundreds of low-paid workers that worked on the perimeter of the disaster site haven't been nearly as visible as those who worked at the site itself. (AP) But the program hasn't been a catch-all solution for all 9/11 first responders, some of whom have been excluded from receiving its benefits, something Feal hopes Congress will address in addition to the $3 billion in extra funding. \"You've been seeing stories about people from the Pentagon that were excluded,\" Feal said. \"The bill will provide about 800 to 1,200 civilians and military from the Pentagon to either go back into the program or get into the program.\" FORMER FLIGHT ATTENDANT TO HONOR 9/11 VICTIMS BY PUSHING BEVERAGE CART FROM BOSTON TO GROUND ZERO Feal said he has been in Washington working toward a solution to the issue, noting he has gotten assurances from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that the funding will be included in this year's omnibus legislation.\u00a0 While the additional funding would be another victory for 9/11 first responders, Feal said there are still issues for which his organization will have to continue fighting.

He also pointed to a rule that all cancers had to be diagnosed after September 2005 for a person to be eligible for the program.

These are things that have prevented people from getting into the program.\" Some of the most vulnerable responders are those who did not work for police and fire departments, and who have adequate insurance, even in retirement. But construction and trade workers who have gotten injured or sick often lost their jobs and health benefits and depend on funding to get the treatment they need. \"A lot of them don't qualify because of some sort of criteria that has hindered them from getting into the program,\" Feal said. \"So every day we advocate for them.\" Michael Lee is a writer for Fox News.

        "text": "Games\nChristian Williams appears to be dragged from his front yard early on March 6 in Bibb County, Georgia, on March 6. (CREDIT: Macon Judicial Circuit District Attorney, Anita R. Howard) Georgia's human services commissioner is firing back at an inquiry into the state's foster care system, saying U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff's efforts \"leave the unfortunate impression that the goals of this investigation are political.\" Lawyers hired by the state wrote a letter Tuesday to the Georgia Democrat and Republican U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, disputing testimony Monday by two Georgia juvenile judges who said Commissioner Candice Broce asked judges to violate state law by keeping some children inappropriately locked in juvenile detention centers. The judges said Broce, in an August meeting, asked judges to order children with mental and behavioral problems to be detained by the Department of Juvenile Justice while the state\u2019s Division of Family and Children Services looked for a place to house them. GA JUDGES ACCUSE CHILD WELFARE LEADER OF VIOLATING STATE LAW This photo shows Georgia Human Services Commissioner Candice Broce, right, testifying in favor of a bill that would slow the flow of children into foster care, Feb. 16, 2023, at the state Capitol in Atlanta. ((AP Photo/Jeff Amy, File)) SPECIAL ED TEACHER ACCUSED OF TRYING TO MEET UP WITH TEEN BOY FOR SEX \"Commissioner Broce did not encourage judges to violate state law, and it has never been DFCS policy to punish a child with complex needs through detention,\" wrote Patrick Strawbridge, a private lawyer hired by the state. The letter says the judges' statements Monday lacked \"critically important context and accuracy\" about a meeting that it says was intended to discuss recent changes in law, possible proposals for more legal changes and ways to better collaborate. It's often hard to find an appropriate place to care for the most troubled juveniles. \"Ultimately the courts and DFCS are in this fight together, and must stay focused on productive efforts to improve Georgia's child welfare system,\" the letter states. Ossoff spokesperson Jake Best said the U.S. Senate Judiciary Human Rights Subcommittee looks forward to interviewing DFCS employees about the judges' testimony and that the panel will seek the agency's cooperation. \"The subcommittee\u2019s investigation is ongoing, and the essential question is whether children in foster care are protected from abuse and neglect given serious concerns raised for years by watchdogs, parents, and the press,\" Best said in a statement. MARRIED TEACHER PREYED ON TEEN STUDENTS AT PRIVATE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL: POLICE Monday's testimony called into question what Broce has touted as one of her top goals: reducing the number of foster children held in hotels or state offices because the state has no other place to put them. The letter defended those efforts, saying the number of children in hotels continues to hover near zero, down from 50 to 70 a night at the beginning of the year. Placing children in hotels typically costs the state $1,500 per child per night, ties up social workers, and denies children a stable environment and needed treatment. The letter also says the child welfare agency is appealing denials of insurance claims for foster children and is paying for residential treatment using other funds while it fights to get the coverage. The department disputes other parts of Ossoff's inquiry, including an analysis that found 1,790 children in state care were reported missing between 2018 and 2022. The letter said Ossoff's staffers didn't share the analysis, so it can't respond directly, but said a 2022 federal report found 3% of Georgia's foster children had been reported missing. That's lower than the midpoint of 47 states included in the report. The agency also said it would seek a new state law to let it share more data with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. ILLINOIS CHILD WELFARE WORKER GUILTY OF ENDANGERMENT AFTER 5-YEAR-OLD BEATEN TO DEATH BY MOM \"DFCS is doing better on this front than many of its neighbors and other states of similar populations,\" the letter stated. It's not clear what Ossoff may propose to remedy problems. He says the investigation is still gathering facts. He and Blackburn started the inquiry in February after questions arose about breakdowns in Georgia's child welfare system, including in a report by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The agency says that despite Blackburn's involvement, Democratic committee staffers appear to be \"exclusively\" running the inquiry. Ossoff will be up for reelection in 2026, and Republican Gov. Brian Kemp could challenge him. Questions about the child welfare system could be a campaign issue. \"The chairman's investigators never once asked what kind of help or assistance the department could use from the federal government \u2014 and that need is considerable,\" the letter stated. \"DFCS remains committed to serving the interests of the state's most vulnerable population and finding workable solutions to the difficulties inherent in working with foster children \u2014 with or without the subcommittee's help.\" Get all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox Subscribed You've successfully subscribed to this newsletter!\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. \u00a92025 FOX News Network, LLC.

Some Georgia residents say they're having a hard time accessing and spending $350 payments the state is making to more than 3 million residents who benefit from Medicaid, subsidized child health insurance, food stamps or cash welfare assistance. Others have been able to access the money, with the state is saying more than 270,000 people claimed $95.5 million in the first three days of the program, including $30 million that has already been spent through more than 580,000 transactions. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp announced the plan to spend up to $1.2 billion in federal COVID-19 aid on the payments in August. GEORGIA TEEN SUFFERED MEDICAL EMERGENCY DURING FLAG FOOTBALL GAME BEFORE DEATH: REPORT Everyone in a household that receives benefits is supposed to get a separate payment, meaning a single parent with two children would get $1,050. The state started transmitting the money electronically to benefit recipients on Tuesday. However, people began running up against limitations. Although the money can be used like a credit or debit card, it can\u2019t be converted into cash or a money order. It also can\u2019t be used to buy tobacco, vaping products, alcohol, guns, lottery tickets or for gaming, gambling and adult entertainment. Crucially, if users transfer the money to an Apple electronic wallet, it can\u2019t be used to make in-store purchases at Walmart because Walmart only accepts Apple Pay online. The department warned Thursday that some other merchants also don\u2019t accept virtual card payments. Some Georgia residents are having trouble accessing the $350 payments from the state for residents who benefit from Medicaid, subsidized child health insurance, food stamps, or cash welfare assistance.  Thousands of commenters flooded the Department of Human Services' Facebook page to complain about their difficulties, including some who said they were embarrassed when they brought a basket of items to a cashier only to be turned away. Others said they could only pay their landlord with a money order, a prohibited transaction under the state's rules. GEORGIA BOARD APPROVES PRODUCTION LICENSES FOR 2 MEDICAL MARIJUANA COMPANIES The department said the top categories for successful purchases so far have been at retail and grocery stores and to pay utility bills. The top categories for declined transactions so far have been for attempts to buy prohibited items or to convert the card to cash. Kemp has already given out income tax rebates and used federal COVID-19 aid to make grants to various groups. He has also proposed spending $2 billion in state surplus next year on property tax rebates and a second round of income tax rebates, if voters reelect him to a second term in November instead of Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams. Those two plans would require legislative approval next year. FORMER GEORGIA CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS SENTENCED FOR ASSAULTING HANDCUFFED INMATE, COVER-UP The spending has incensed Democrats, who claim Kemp is trying to buy reelection. Under state law, Kemp controls how billions in federal COVID-19 relief is spent, meaning he can hand out money even as he bashes Democratic President Joe Biden and Abrams for high inflation and spending. The governor again said that his reason for handing out cash was to help people pressured by higher prices, even though economists agree that such spending worsens inflation by dumping more cash into the economy to bid up the prices of goods and services.

WALES, Maine \u2014 Animal welfare officials have seized more than 60 cats from a woman who was subject of a seizure of her cats three years ago. Animal welfare agents, who counted 63 live cats and 31 dead cats, described horrific conditions in the home in Wales, WGME-TV reported. They were at the home on Wednesday. Concern over the cats\u2019 care drove the state to take away 83 cats and kittens in November 2019. But a judge ultimately ruled that most of the cats should be returned and that the owner didn't violate \"permissible standards of care.\" A cat lies in the sun on a backyard patio (iStock) This time, a Department of Health and Human Services worker reported the conditions after visiting the house, WGME-TV reported. Liam Hughes, director of animal welfare for the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, said most of the cats that were seized Wednesday had respiratory issues, ear and eye infections. He urged anyone overwhelmed or having trouble caring for animals to reach out to a local shelter or animal control officer. \"They can help tie you into resources to help reduce the problems that you\u2019re seeing,\" Hughes said.

        "text": "Games\nRep. Rob Kauffman, R-Pa., joins \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend\u2019 to discuss his town\u2019s ongoing fight against a planned migrant shelter. My mother immigrated to Pittsburgh from Guatemala in the early 1980s under President Reagan, and I spent my first 20 years of life in South Hills. Unfortunately, today my hometown is nearly unrecognizable to me.\u00a0 The reason why is simple: The system that existed when my mom came to the United States has been completely overwhelmed by the sheer number of migrants crossing our southern border today.\u00a0 In the last two years, the migrant population in Pittsburgh has soared by 2,000%, and now it\u2019s reaching crisis levels.\u00a0 Vice President Kamala Harris, greets supporters during a campaign event at Cochise College Douglas Campus on Sept. 27, 2024, in Douglas, Arizona. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) According to a Sept. 15\u00a0segment aired by CBS Pittsburgh, Charleroi \u2013 a borough nested along the Monongahela River \u2013 has been especially impacted by this influx. Schools are overstrained. Local stores are seeing less business because of crime concerns. And residents are watching their culture vanish before their eyes.\u00a0 KAMALA HARRIS MAKES A DESPERATE MOVE ON A CRITICAL ISSUE TO SAVE A SINKING CAMPAIGN This isn\u2019t an accident. Since 2021, the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s immigration policies have allowed the entry of millions of inadmissible aliens at a completely unsustainable rate.\u00a0 I can attest that the situation unfolding in Western Pennsylvania is unprecedented and unrecognizable. Pennsylvanians deserve an ordered and sustainable immigration system that does not impact their quality of life. \u00a0 Overburdened public systems resulting from mass immigration are one of the main concerns identified by Charleroi residents and cost Pennsylvanians $1.2 billion annually to cover medical, welfare and education expenses. Schools in Charleroi are especially suffering with the number of migrants needing to learn English. The district has already spent $400,000 on English Language Learner (ELL) teachers and interpreters, but it is nowhere near enough to meet the demand. DEMOCRATS LIE BIG ABOUT OUR BORDER CRISIS. COMPARE SENATE AND HOUSE BILLS FOR PROOF In Cornell School District \u2013 near Coraopolis \u2013 ELL class sizes\u00a0have doubled from just last year. Further south in Ringgold, the school board just approved\u00a0$142,000 or roughly $7,000 per student for English as a Second Language (ESL) services between\u00a02024-2045.\u00a0 Not only is this a financial burden on taxpayers, but it makes the overall learning experience more difficult for existing students. Classrooms already face teacher shortages. Now more students are being added to them \u2013 with many not able to fully participate in the classroom due to language barriers.\u00a0 These challenges may explain why standardized test scores in public schools around Pittsburgh have\u00a0drastically fallen since 2019. And, of course, almost no parents or students had a say in any of this.\u00a0 Aside from over-filled schools and financial strains, the influx of migrants resettled by the Biden-Harris administration in Western Pennsylvania has also created crime concerns. KAMALA HARRIS IS THE ARCHITECT OF 'AMERICA LAST' BORDER POLICIES Things are so bad that one Charleroi resident mentioned she was \"afraid to go into\" downtown stores because of crime.\u00a0 It\u2019s not hard to share the resident\u2019s concerns as the Biden-Harris administration has facilitated the entry of at least 12 million illegal immigrants into the country \u2013 many of whom have already committed additional crimes, if they\u2019re backgrounds aren\u2019t completely unknown. Since the Biden-Harris administration took office, Pennsylvania has seen a number of high-profile illegal immigrant crimes \u2013 including murders of\u00a0ex-partners, friends and even children. While these heinous incidents do not represent the entire immigrant population, they represent something that should be widely noted: These crimes should have never happened in the first place. The culprit should have never been in the country as they were here unlawfully.\u00a0 SELFISH KAMALA HARRIS POURS GASOLINE ON PITTSBURGH SANDWICH SHOP\u2019S VANCE GAFFE Pittsburgh is in peril. It is on the verge of becoming another New York or Chicago or Boston \u2013 cities completely taken over by mass immigration to the point where residents are fleeing. \u00a0 But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Western Pennsylvania has a choice. We can continue the status quo of chaos or return to an immigration system that puts Pennsylvanians first.\u00a0 Immigration can even be good for Pittsburgh, the state of Pennsylvania, and the rest of the United States. But it can only be good within reasonable limits.\u00a0 Our immigration system today must better prioritize skills, education, English literacy and a commitment to assimilate into American society. It must promote order and selectiveness to ensure Pennsylvanians aren\u2019t suffering at the cost of foreign nationals.\u00a0 CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies reflected principles of a\u00a0merit-based and ordered immigration system. This helps explain why Pennsylvanians were much happier with their quality of life between\u00a02016-2020. Immigration can have a high price. But it can also be a net benefit if managed correctly.\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Matthew Tragesser works at The Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., and previously served as the communications director for U.S. Rep.

Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) deployed troops to Gaza for the first time since the collapse of Israel's ceasefire agreement with Hamas on Wednesday. The IDF troops are deployed to the Netzarim corridor, a key section of Gaza that essentially cuts the strip in half. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has continued to vow that Israel will maintain is military operations until every hostage has been returned from Hamas custody. The IDF described Wednesday's deployment as a \"limited ground operation,\" but has not said whether it will remain limited to the Netzarim corridor. The move follows a multi-day wave of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza that killed over 400 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. ISRAEL SHOOTS DOWN HOUTHI BALLISTIC MISSILE AFTER CEASEFIRE COLLAPSES Israeli troops deployed to Gaza on Tuesday. (IDF) The IDF says its strikes on Monday and Tuesday eliminated a number of mid- and high-level Hamas officials. Among them was Essam al-Da'alis, head of the Hamas government and \"the most senior figure of authority in the Gaza Strip.\" REMAINS OF SHIRI BIBAS, MOM OF TWO KILLED, ALLEGEDLY RETURNED TO ISRAEL FOLLOWING HAMAS' BROKEN PROMISE The IDF and ISA also determined with \"high probability\" that Israeli strikes eliminated Mahmoud Marzouk Ahmed Abu-Watfa, the Minister of Internal Affairs in charge of Hamas' Internal Security Forces; Bahajat Hassan Mohammed Abu-Sultan, who served as Head of Hamas' Internal Security Forces; and Ahmed Amar Abdullah Alhata, who served as Hamas' Minister of Justice. Israeli troops deployed to Gaza. (IDF) Israel on Wednesday also said it eliminated Yasser Muhammad Harb Musa, who was responsible for security affairs in Hamas' political bureau, in addition to Muhammad Al-Jamasi, Head of the Hamas Emergency Committee. President Donald Trump's administration backed Israel's move to end the ceasefire in a statement on Monday. HOW ISRAEL'S WAR AGAINST HAMAS TERRORISTS WILL BE DIFFERENT UNDER TRUMP \"Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war,\" National Security Council (NSC) spokesman Brian Hughes told Fox News. The White House has not responded to the deployment of Troops in Gaza on Wednesday.

A volunteer firefighter has been charged with misdemeanor obstruction while the investigation into the deaths of two Georgia teenagers continues. Scott Kerlin, 42, is a Towns County volunteer firefighter \"who took photos of the Lewis twins\u2019 death scene and shared them publicly,\" the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said in a Tuesday update. The family of twin Georgia brothers, Qaadir Malik Lewis and Naazir Rahim Lewis, 19, do not believe the two died of murder-suicide, as authorities say.\u00a0 The brothers, from Gwinnett County, Georgia, were found dead at the top of Bell Mountain by hikers on March 8, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said in a media release.

Under a shutdown, the executive branch has sole power to determine what is \u2018essential.\u2019 And they can determine without any court supervision. The courts have ruled it's solely up to the executive what to shut down,\" Schumer said.\u00a0 DEM SENATOR ON SCHUMER FUTURE: 'IMPORTANT' TO KNOW 'WHEN IT'S TIME TO GO' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer leaves the Democratic caucus lunch at the U.S. Capitol on March 13, 2025. (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) Schumer alleged, without evidence, that Trump, Department of Government Efficiency chair Elon Musk and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought would slash funding for SNAP, or food stamps and mass transit, as well as cut Medicaid \"by 20, 30, 50, 80%\" He suggested the administration could decide during a government shutdown, \"We\u2019ll go after Social Security. We\u2019ll go after the veterans.\"\u00a0 \"They would eviscerate the federal government,\" Schumer said. \"Their goal is just eviscerate the federal government so they can get more taxes in their tax cuts to their billionaire class over there. So it would be devastating.\" \"There\u2019s no off ramp,\" he added. \"Who determines how long the shutdown would last? Only those evil people at the top of the executive branch in the Trump administration.\"\u00a0 Schumer told NBC that a Republican senator close to the DOGE team told a Democratic colleague of his that the administration would keep the shutdown in place for \"six months, nine months, a year til everyone was furloughed and gone and quit.\"\u00a0 \"And there would be no way to stop it,\" Schumer said. \"So I thought that would be so devastating to the republic and anger so many people.\"\u00a0 Schumer, who played a critical role in urging Joe Biden to exit the 2024 race, denied that he was acting similarly in resisting calls from his party to resign as leader. Democrats have increasingly criticized Schumer for breaking with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in supporting the continuing resolution, and Schumer has dismissed reports of a potential primary challenge by progressive \"Squad\" member Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., for his Senate seat.\u00a0 House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries speaks during a news conference at the Capitol, in Washington, March 6, 2025. (AP Photo/J.

Sometimes, when you're a leader, you have to do things to avoid a real danger that might come down the curve, and I did it out of pure conviction as to what a leader should do and what the right thing for America and my party was,\" Schumer said, admitting that there's \"disagreement\" in the Democratic caucus on the spending bill, but \"We've all agree to respect each other because each side saw why the other side felt so strongly about it.\"\u00a0 \"And our caucus is united in fighting Donald Trump every step of the way,\" Schumer claimed. \"Our goal, our plan, which we're united on, is to make Donald Trump the quickest lame duck in modern history by showing how bad his policies are.\"\u00a0 \"He represents the oligarchs, as I've said, he's hurting average people in every way,\" Schumer added, saying Democrats are using oversight hearings, the courts and organizing across districts to challenge Trump's agenda.\u00a0 \"I believe that by 2026, the Republicans in the House and Senate will feel like they're rats on a sinking ship because we have so gone after Trump and all the horrible things he's doing,\" Schumer said.\u00a0 Forrmer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested Democrats gained nothing from conceding on the continuing resolution.

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, the former House Speaker, has claimed Democrats did not gain anything in Schumer conceding to Republicans' over the CR.\u00a0 \"What we got, at the end of the day,\" Schumer responded, \"is avoiding the horror of a shutdown.\"\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\u00a0 He added that Democrats had \"no leverage point,\" because Republicans in control of both houses could force a vote on the CR. \"When you're on that political mountain, the higher up you climb, the more fiercely the winds blow,\" Schumer said. \"The only way you stop being blown off the mountain is your internal gyroscope\u2026 I had to do the right thing for our country and for our party.\"\u00a0 Danielle Wallace is a breaking news and politics reporter at Fox News Digital.

Use official conversion tools:\u00a0Instead of relying on random online tools, download and use reputable document conversion software provided by reputable companies like Adobe Acrobat, LibreOffice or Microsoft Office. These programs let you convert files securely without exposing your data to potential threats. 2. Check the website\u2019s reputation:\u00a0Before using an online converter, research the site. Look for reviews and see if cybersecurity forums or sources have flagged it as unsafe. If the site lacks basic security measures, avoid it. 3. Avoid downloading executable files:\u00a0If an online document converter provides an .exe, .bat or .scr file instead of a standard document format, do not download or run it. Legitimate converters should only generate files like .pdf, .docx or .png, not executables that could contain malware. 4. Scan files after conversion: Even if you use a trusted converter, always scan the converted file with up-to-date\u00a0strong antivirus software before opening it. 5. Check file permissions: After conversion, verify that the new file doesn't have unexpected permissions or properties that could indicate malware. 6. Create backups and enable ransomware protection:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0back up important documents on an external drive or a secure cloud service. Some security suites, like Microsoft Defender, offer ransomware protection features that prevent unauthorized changes to your files. 7. Be cautious of browser extensions: Avoid installing browser extensions for file conversion, as these can often be browser hijackers or adware. 8. Consider paid services: If you frequently need to convert files, invest in a reputable paid service that offers better security and privacy protection. 9. Use cloud-based solutions: Consider using cloud-based productivity suites that offer built-in conversion tools, reducing the need for third-party converters. FBI'S NEW WARNING ABOUT AI-DRIVEN SCAMS THAT ARE AFTER YOUR CASH The convenience of free online tools often blinds us to the risks they carry. Many users assume that if a website looks professional or ranks high on Google, it must be safe. Cybercriminals understand this mindset and take full advantage of it. The real issue is not just malware-laced converters but the habit of trading security for convenience without a second thought. The internet is filled with services that appear free but come at the hidden cost of stolen data, financial fraud or compromised devices. Instead of trusting every tool that offers an easy solution, it is important to think critically about what we are giving away whenever we upload a file or click a download button.

        "text": "Games\nHighlights of the 2021 budget include increased military spending and $2 billion for the border wall. David Spunt reports from the White House. The White House\u00a0on Sunday unveiled a $4.8 trillion budget proposal that would slash spending dramatically on foreign aid and social safety nets,\u00a0while including $2 billion for a southern border wall and substantially boosting\u00a0funding to NASA, the Department of Veterans Affairs\u00a0and the Department of Homeland Security. Fox News has confirmed the details of the budget, which The Wall Street Journal\u00a0first reported. The package, set to be formally announced on Monday,\u00a0as-is stood little chance of passage in the\u00a0House of Representatives, which the Democrats have controlled. Still, it served as a signal of the president's priorities as Republicans have aimed to retake\u00a0the chamber in the 2020 elections. The plan aims to eliminate the federal deficit -- or the difference between spending and revenue that is slated to exceed\u00a0$1 trillion this year -- by 2035. In all, the White House is seeking to cut $4.4 trillion in federal spending over the next 10 years, including reductions in spending on food stamps and federal disability benefits through more stringent work and eligibility requirements. TRUMP TAKES ON 'RADICAL LEFT' IN DEFIANT STATE OF THE UNION Total cuts to \"non-defense discretionary programs,\u201d which\u00a0do\u00a0not include Medicare or Social Security, amount to $2 trillion in savings under the plan. The budget additionally calls for renewing the Trump administration's tax cuts for individuals and families that would otherwise expire in 2025. Modifications in Medicare prescription-drug pricing would account for\u00a0$130 billion in savings. \"Working together, the Congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels,\" Trump said during last week's State of the Union address.\u00a0\"I have been speaking to Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and others in the Congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done properly. I am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. Get a bill to my desk, and I will sign it into law without delay.\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.,\u00a0bashed the plan Sunday night. \"The budget is a statement of values and once again the president is showing just how little he values the good health, financial security and well-being of hard-working American families.\" Foreign aid would be reduced by 21 percent, in keeping with the president's push to have other countries pay what he calls their \"fair share\" for their own defense. Trump's temporary suspension of aid to Ukraine helped trigger impeachment proceedings; one of Republicans' defenses was that the president has long sought to suspend or reduce U.S. financial commitments overseas -- especially to notoriously\u00a0corrupt countries. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would face a massive 26-percent reduction in funding. The Trump administration has\u00a0rolled back Obama-era EPA regulations and oversight, saying they have hurt the economy for little benefit. The proposal also\u00a0would cut\u00a0the\u00a0Department of Housing and Urban Development's budget by 15 percent, while incorporating $2.8 billion for grants to help combat homelessness. And, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would see a 9 percent cut, although\u00a0its $4.3 billion allocation for fighting infectious disease would remain amid the\u00a0coronavirus spread. Homeland Security's budget would grow by 3 percent; the National Nuclear Security Administration's by 19 percent; and the Department of Veterans Affairs' by 13 percent. WOOHOO! NASA ASTRONAUT CHRISTINA KOCH RETURNS SAFELY TO EARTH AFTER 11 MONTH JOURNEY The Fiscal Year 2021 budget further aims to increase military spending 0.3 percent to $740.5 billion. It doubles spending on artificial\u00a0intelligence from $973 million to nearly $2 billion by 2022, including a focus on quantum computing. Fox News reported this weekend on the budget's 12-percent hike in NASA funding, with the goal of returning astronauts to the moon. No one has been to the moon since 1972 under NASA's now-shuttered Apollo program. Since taking office, Trump has made space exploration one of its top priorities, and his administration has set a target of 2024 for the next lunar landing. NASA's new space program named\u00a0Artemis, for the Greek goddess of the moon and sister to Apollo, has aimed to put the first woman on\u00a0the moon. Long-term, NASA has wanted to establish a sustainable human presence on the moon with the goal of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s. Trump\u2019s budget specifically would increase NASA spending from about $22.6 billion to $25.2 billion in\u00a0fiscal 2021, one of the biggest spending increases\u00a0requested since the 1990s.\u00a0$3 billion will go toward\u00a0new funding to develop human landers. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The\u00a0big lunar budget request was in addition to Trump's other astronomical project: the Space Force. Trump signed an Oval Office directive last February to make the Space Force the sixth branch of the military, with a mission\u00a0to patrol the orbit and protect the U.S. from attacks. \"Just weeks ago, for the first time since President Truman established the Air Force more than 70 years earlier, we created a brand-new branch of the U.S. armed forces,\" Trump said at the State of the Union.\u00a0\"It is called the Space Force.

        "text": "Games\nSNAP, welfare, and a look at why the Farm Bill is so controversial The Trump administration announced a plan Thursday to tighten work requirements for work-eligible Americans on food stamps -- a move the\u00a0Department of Agriculture says will nudge those on welfare toward self-sufficiency. The USDA announced that the rule, which will apply to able-bodied adults without dependents, will\u00a0restrict the ability of states to exempt recipients from having to hold a job to receive the benefits. Currently, able-bodied recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) must work 20 hours a week or enroll in job training to maintain benefits, after their first three months in the program.\u00a0But states can waive the requirement if\u00a0their unemployment rates are above 10 percent or they show a demonstrable lack of jobs. States can also grant extensions of benefits for 15 percent of work-eligible adults without a waiver, and if they don\u2019t use that waiver, they can bank the exemptions for later. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The new rule only allows waivers for specific cities or counties that have an unemployment rate of 7 percent or higher, and that waiver will be\u00a0only eligible for one year. States can no longer bank exemptions and cannot grant waivers for geographic areas larger than a specific jurisdiction. \u201cLong-term reliance on government assistance has never been part of the American dream,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement. \u201cAs we make benefits available to those who truly need them, we must also encourage participants to take proactive steps toward self-sufficiency. Moving people to work is common-sense policy, particularly at a time when the unemployment rate is at a generational low.\u201d HOUSE OVERWHELMINGLY PASSES FARM BILL, WITHOUT TIGHTER WORK REQUIREMENT FAVORED BY TRUMP In 2016, 3.8 million able-bodied adults without disabilities were on SNAP benefits, with 2.8 million of them not working, according to the USDA. \u201cAmericans are generous people who believe it is their responsibility to help their fellow citizens when they encounter a difficult stretch,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cThat is the commitment behind SNAP. But like other federal welfare programs, it was never intended to be a way of life.\u201d The Trump administration had been pushing for food stamp reform to be included in the farm bill that recently passed through Congress -- but work provisions were scrapped as part of a push to get it through. Democrats soon attacked the latest\u00a0proposal, and questioned its legality. \u201cCongress writes laws, and the administration is required to write rules based on the law,\u201d said Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., according to The Washington Post. \u201cAdministrative changes should not be driven by ideology. I do not support unilateral and unjustified changes that would take food away from families.\u201d House Agriculture Chairman Michael Conaway, R-Texas, who pushed for tighter SNAP work requirements in the House farm bill, praised the move\u00a0for \"creating a roadmap for states to more effectively engage ABAWDs in this booming economy.\" Perdue said the rule is a tradeoff for Trump\u2019s signature on the $400 billion bill, and the administration would rather not have to make the reforms by regulation. \u201cWe would much rather have Congress enact these important reforms for the SNAP program,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, these regulatory changes by the USDA will save hardworking taxpayers $15 billion over 10 years and give President Trump comfort enough to support a farm bill he might otherwise have opposed.\" The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Ed Hawthorne, president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO, said such a fund would \"level the playing field for working people\" and allow them to strike without facing foreclosures, evictions and repossessions.

        "text": "Games\nA panel of residents from Boston, Denver and Chicago weigh in on the sanctuary city mayors' heated testimony on Capitol Hill during 'Fox & Friends First.' An accused child rapist illegally in the U.S. was recently arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement Boston, the agency announced on Thursday. ICE Boston said Stivenson Omar Perez-Ajtzalan, 19, was arrested on Jan. 30 for aggravated rape of a child in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The victim is said to be more than 10 years younger than Perez, who is a Guatemalan national. He was arraigned on the felony charges in Lawrence District Court on Dec. 20, 2024. BRAZILIAN ILLEGAL ALIEN CHARGED WITH RAPE CAUGHT IN MASSACHUSETTS, HANDED OVER TO ICE IN RARE CASE\u00a0 Guatemalan national Stivenson Omar Perez-Ajtzalan, 19, was arrested on Jan. 30 for aggravated rape of a child 10 years younger than him, according to ICE Boston. (ICE Boston) ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston acting Field Office Director Patricia Hyde said Perez not only displayed a \"blatant disregard\" for America's immigration laws, but he also sexually assaulted a child. \"He came to this country to do harm, and now he must be made to face the consequences of his actions. ICE Boston will remain dedicated to our mission of protecting public safety by arresting and removing illegal alien offenders from New England,\" Hyde said. BOSTON POLICE COMMISSIONER DOUBLES DOWN ON ICE RESISTANCE: 'WE DON\u2019T ENFORCE' DETAINERS\u00a0 Perez was allegedly released back into the community by the court, who did not inform ICE of his release, according to Fox News' Bill Melugin. ICE was also unable to file a detainer because the court released him so quickly. \"Massachusetts continues to be the only state I've seen in my coverage that frequently releases aliens not only charged with child rape, but aggravated child rape, without any notice to ICE,\" Melugin said. Perez was given a notice to appear before a Justice Department immigration judge after his arrest and he was placed into removal proceedings, according to ICE Boston. He remains in ICE custody. Massachusetts has made headlines since President Donald Trump was elected for acting in defiance of his administration's immigration crackdown.\u00a0 Gov. Maura Healey said in November that her state police will \"absolutely not\" be cooperating with mass deportation efforts and warned that she will use \"every tool in the toolbox\" to \"protect\" residents of her state.

        "text": "Games\nFOX News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson has more on tracking the COVID pandemic relief funds on 'Special Report.' A Portland family fears they could be left with no option other than to sell their home after a glitch in the freshly-revamped unemployment insurance system spiraled into a devastating problem that left a recently laid-off father unable to collect. \"It\u2019s been five weeks, coming up on six weeks now, that I have seen dime zero. We\u2019ve burned through our reserves,\" Gregory Smith told Portland's KOIN 6 News. Smith was the household's only employed member, and his job loss early last month left the family desperate to receive something to sustain them as they wait for the new system to get sorted. ST. LOUIS WOMAN DECLARED DEAD 16 YEARS AGO BEGS GOVERNMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE SHE'S ALIVE: \u2018ONE IS TOO MANY\u2019 Gregory Smith said his unemployment insurance benefits have been delayed due to an error in the new system. (iStock) Unfortunately, their troubles seem to be relentless. The systematic error wreaking so much havoc, Smith said, comes from one incorrect digit entered in his address. According to the report, he has tried multiple times to get the issue resolved and has done so in multiple ways, but his efforts keep coming up dry. \"I\u2019ve got two kids, a wife, pretty decent house that I worked really, really hard, 50-60 hours a week for seven years to be able to remodel my house and make it this happy place for my family,\" he told the outlet.\u00a0 MISSOURI WOMAN LIVING OFF FATHER'S VA BENEFITS ARRESTED AFTER 95-YEAR-OLD DAD FOUND BURIED IN BACKYARD The Oregon Employment Department recently implemented a new website that is reportedly creating issues for some state residents. (Fox News) \"And because of a simple typographical error that I cannot \u2014 somehow cannot \u2014 get repaired, it\u2019s likely that I may lose this house.\" The state Employment Department's new website rollout is affecting other Oregonians as well. Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Wednesday that former Oregon Health and Science University employee Harvest Rich's hardship with the platform is despite she and her husband both qualifying for unemployment benefits. WEST VIRGINIA BILL ADDING WORK SEARCH TO UNEMPLOYMENT, FREEZING BENEFITS MADE LAW WITHOUT SIGNATURE She told the outlet, \"You don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be denied, if you might be expecting a check in the next week or two \u2014 you know nothing.\" Problems persist once the claimant's benefit is flagged. The claim then undergoes a process known as adjudication to investigate and determine the outcome. \"Representatives with the state employment department say because of the migration to the new online system, they do not know how many claims are waiting to get looked at by an adjudicator. They also lack information on how long it\u2019s taking for claims in adjudication to get resolved,\" the report reads. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Smith, meanwhile, insists that the revamped system should be fixed for the benefit of those displaced by its rollout. Fox News Digital reached out to the Oregon Employment Department for comment, and received the following statement: \"We can\u2019t comment on any one case without a release. We recognize that people are already facing difficult situations with the loss of employment and that waiting any amount of time for that first benefit check is difficult. We also acknowledge that it is especially frustrating when they can\u2019t get through to us on the phone or have to wait on hold for long periods when they do. However, we need time to make sure customers are both eligible for the program and that they are who they say they are. Unfortunately, this is taking longer than we and our customers would like. \"The biggest reason is that our staffing levels remain low compared to our workload because of chronic federal underfunding.\u00a0The good news is that help is on the way, as House Bill 4035 becomes effective this June and will provide additional administrative funding for 72 positions. The positive impacts of this bill will be felt toward the second half of the year at the earliest, as it takes time to hire and train new staff. In the meantime, we are currently exploring all options and tactics to resolve claims as quickly possible and support customers throughout the claim process.\" Taylor Penley is an associate editor with Fox News.

Tim Walz is a moderate VP candidate, and her candidacy to unseat 'Squad' member Rep. Ilhan Omar.\u00a0 Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is facing renewed scrutiny for a $250 million COVID-19 fraud scandal in Minnesota that critics say falls on his shoulders as governor, particularly after he was tapped as a running mate for Kamala Harris on the 2024 Democratic ticket. Between 2022 and 2024, 70 people have been charged in connection with the fraud scheme that resulted in a quarter-billion-dollar loss from the Minnesota Department of Education's (MDE) Feeding Our Future program \u2014 a federally funded meal assistance plan meant to help give free meals to eligible children and adults. \"At least a quarter billion dollars was stolen by fraudsters,\" Billy Glahn, adjunct policy fellow with Minnesota-based Center of the American Experiment, told Fox News Digital of the scandal. \"The question, of course, came up: How did the state Department of Education let out $250 million out the door to people who were later convicted of defrauding the program? The legislative auditor took this on as one of her projects and did this report looking at how the department oversaw a single one of these nonprofits involved.\" WALZ'S HANDLING OF BLM RIOTS, STRICT COVID RULES UNDER MICROSCOPE AFTER HARRIS VP PICK Democratic vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks during a campaign event on Aug. 7, 2024, in Detroit, Michigan. (Andrew Harnik) Glahn is referencing a report from the Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor (OLA), which frequently releases state government oversight reports. The report about fraud scheme in question, titled \"Minnesota Department of Education: Oversight of Feeding Our Future,\" was released in June. In it, legislative auditor Judy Randall concludes that although MDE officials told OLA they quickly identified and stopped the fraud, OLA believes they could have done more to prevent $250 million in stolen funds. \"MDE officials told us that the department began to have concerns about Feeding Our Future only after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we think MDE failed to act on warning signs known to the department prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and prior to the start of the alleged fraud,\" the report states.\u00a0 VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS NAMES MINNESOTA GOV TIM WALZ AS HER RUNNING MATE It continues later on: \"More broadly, the failures we highlight in this report are symptoms of a department that was ill-prepared to respond to the issues it encountered with Feeding Our Future.\" Kamala Harris ended weeks of speculation about who her running mate would be, selecting the 60-year-old Midwestern governor over other candidates.\u00a0 (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Critics say this failure goes back to Walz's leadership as governor. \"The buck has to stop somewhere,\" as Glahn put it. \"He is the chief executive of the state. All of the people at the Department of Education and the other departments where fraud has taken place were appointed by him,\" Glahn noted. \"So he appoints the commissioner, the deputy commissioner, assistant commissioners. They were all appointed by him. They all report to him. And these are the folks whom the legislative auditor has documented failed to do their job. So where does the buck stop?\" IT'S OFFICIAL: VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS FORMALLY WINS DEMOCRAT PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION Glahn said Minnesota residents may be surprised that their state is not the well-oiled machine it once was. His response to the scandal, he said, is \"much more cynical.\" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks at a Biden-Harris campaign and DNC press conference on July 17, 2024, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. (Jim Vondruska/Getty Images) \"It's been uncovered that a lot of these people who were indicted . . . and their spouses and immediate family members and business partners have given a lot of money to Democrats, to campaign contributions,\" Glahn noted. \"So, they're campaign contributors. And then when these nonprofits were having trouble with Department of Education, the Department of Education shut off the money a couple of times and failed, or they didn't have the courage or convictions, and politicians went to bat for the nonprofits.\" Glahn added that the scheme highlights the notion that \"government is about beneficiaries and getting money out the door, not about policing and oversight and regulatory mindset and making sure that the people are eligible\" for such benefits programs. Fraud suspects spent the money on everything from residential property to vehicles, luxury goods, jewelry, cryptocurrency, hotels and restaurants, airplane tickets and more,\u00a0 WALZ SLAMMED FOR \u2018HESITATING\u2019 TO SEND IN GUARD AS DAUGHTER TIPPED OFF RIOTERS VIA SOCIAL MEDIA Walz's office did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Fox News Digital, but in a statement to local news outlet the Star Tribune, a spokesperson for the governor said, \"We appreciate the OLA\u2019s work and often agree with them, which is why state agencies have implemented many of their suggestions.\" The spokesperson added that \"[t]here are also times when the OLA\u2019s suggestions don\u2019t apply because the audits come out years after we\u2019ve resolved an issue, they suggest actions that have already been taken, or they evaluate programs that no longer exist.\" \"Sometimes,\" the spokesperson continued, \"state agencies have expertise and knowledge that the OLA does not, and in those cases we may fundamentally disagree,\" according to the Star Tribune. The Republican candidate for Minnesota's 2nd Congressional District, Joe Teirab, said in a post on X that the fraud under Walz's watch has exceeded half-a-billion dollars. \"Imagine fraud at that scale nationwide.\" \"Governor Walz and the people he directly hired and oversaw lost half a billion dollars to fraud in a few short years as governor. Imagine fraud at that scale nationwide,\" Teirab said. \"If every state lost that much, the amount lost to fraud would be greater than the annual budgets of over 15 states.\" In a follow-up post responding to an ABC story on the fraud scandal, Teirab said, \"[i]t isn\u2019t just the Feeding Our Future case.\" \"Over half a billion dollars has been lost by his Administration so far, with instances of waste and/or fraud in child care programs, the frontline worker bonus pay program, unemployment benefits, Medicaid programs, and more,\" he explained. \"It\u2019s not the fact that his Administration let fraudsters walk away with over $250 million meant to feed hungry kids. It\u2019s the fact that that wasn\u2019t a wake-up call, and that there still hasn\u2019t been any accountability. Not one state employee has been fired for any of this.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Critics of Walz's handling of taxpayer funds have also noted an $18 billion surplus in Walz's $72 billion budget that was initially supposed to be returned to taxpayers but was spent on other state initiatives instead.\u00a0 \"We know that when there is tax relief offered for young families\u2026 as great as that sounds, and we are appreciative of that point, if Minnesota wasn't such an expensive place to live,\" House Minority Leader Lisa Demuth said in March. \"In addition to that $18 billion of surplus that is now gone, taxes and fees \u2013 our state budget \u2013 was raised by another $10 billion.

The leaked data includes photographs and scans of passports, driver\u2019s licenses, credit cards, release forms (contracts), social security numbers, national identification cards, and handwritten bios, among other information, according to a report from vpnMentor. The source of the leaks is PussyCash, an adult affiliate network, the firm wrote in the report. The adult site, including a site known as ImLive, says it has 66 million members. PussyCash hosts affiliate programs for multiple adult sites, paying webmasters for traffic sent to the sites through banners and exit traffic.

The Virginia agency that processes unemployment benefits has made progress clearing pandemic-related backlogs, but it isn't expected to finish until next summer, a top official told lawmakers this week. Jeff Ryan, chief deputy commissioner of the Virginia Employment Commission, told lawmakers at an oversight committee meeting Wednesday that so-called first-level appeals are the largest backlog pressure point, with an estimated 45,000 cases the agency doesn't expect to clear until July 2024. VIRGINIA EMPLOYMENT COMMISSION OPENS INVESTIGATION FOR 4,200 POTENTIALLY COMPROMISED UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS Ryan also said the agency has sped up first-time payments, though he acknowledged continued struggles to provide some core services.

VIRGINIA WOMAN SENTENCED FOLLOWING PANDEMIC FRAUD Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin campaigned on a pledge to improve performance at the agency, which officials have said was at an especially low staffing level when the coronavirus pandemic began. Government measures intended to slow COVID-19's spread led to a surge in jobless claims. The employment commission, like many other state agencies, couldn't keep up and by some federal metrics, its performance was exceptionally poor. While some lawmakers said they appreciated improvements the agency has made, they also continue to hear complaints. After Ryan told the panel that customer service measures like call-back and wait times at call centers were improving, Democratic Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker said she'd heard differently from residents of her northern Virginia district. She said she tried getting through to the call center line just before Wednesday's meeting and received an error message saying call volume was too high. Ryan acknowledged the queue is \"maxed out\" at times, but said he didn't have numbers detailing how often customers encounter that problem. Jonathon Brashears told the group he'd traveled from Virginia Beach in \"desperate hopes\" of finding someone to help him with a claim stemming from a July 2021 layoff. Brashears, whom Ryan pledged to assist, described a series of agency errors and poor customer service, calling the experience \"a nightmare.\" \"The VEC is not incompetent. They\u2019re just working with limited resources within extremely challenging circumstances,\" said Democratic Sen. Adam Ebbin, who leads the legislative panel and has pushed for more agency funding. Ryan said a bright spot for the VEC and Virginia at large was the strength of the state's labor market. The unemployment rate in October was 2.7%, and labor force participation rates have been steadily rising. In October, the rate stood at 66.8%, higher than it was before the pandemic and higher than neighboring and competitor states like Florida, Texas, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Ryan also told lawmakers the agency has made significant progress improving the percentage of claims paid within 21 days. DOJ APPOINTS PROSECUTOR FOR PANDEMIC RELIEF FUND FRAUD For the third quarter of this year, that rate was 65.8%, the highest in the past two years, Ryan noted, though it's still below the 87% the federal Department of Labor considers acceptable. The average wait on the agency's first-level appeals was 516 days in the same quarter, third-worst in the nation, according to the Department of Labor, which says that number should be 30 days or less. \"What that means in practice is that when that first decision is wrong, it\u2019s going to take 17 months to fix when it should be fixed in a month,\" said Flannery O'Rourke, a staff attorney at the Virginia Poverty Law Center. The attorney general continues to pursue fraudulent unemployment claims, and total court-ordered restitution so far stands at about $360,000, Ryan said. The employment commission has paid out more than $1.7 billion in fraudulent claims, according to figures provided Thursday by a spokeswoman.

Under the terms of the settlement, the county must also implement policies and computer software that will enable Child Welfare Services to better track and follow up on allegations of child abuse, according to a statement by the law firm Panish Shea Boyle Ravipudi. Tulare County officials and its attorneys did not immediately respond Monday to requests for comment on the settlement.

Pritzker said Tuesday that the state's relatively low jobless rate will help him keep his promise to pay off coronavirus-era debt in the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund by year's end. The Democrat announced he will transfer $450 million from the account set aside to pay jobless benefits toward the debt that ballooned to $4.5 billion during business closures forced by COVID-19. That decreases the remaining balance of the federal loan to $1.8 billion, which Pritzker pledged will be eliminated by the new year. Illinois joined dozens of other states in borrowing money to pay unemployment claims which, in Illinois, surged in spring 2020 to levels not seen since 1982. ILLINOIS MAYOR DEMANDS APOLOGY FROM GOV.

Republicans argued for paying the entire balance with federal money while it was available and to spare increased taxes on employers who fund the account. But a robust economy has played a key role, said Kristin Richards, director of the Illinois Department of Employment Security. August unemployment in Illinois was 4.8%, down from 6.1% a year earlier.

PRITZKER CALLS ON DEM STATE SENATORS TO RESIGN AMID ACCUSATIONS OF BRIBERY, DOMESTIC ABUSE Tuesday's announcement reflects continued growth in the state's economy, Richards said. \"Statewide payroll jobs are up compared to a year ago,\" she said. \"We are seeing significant gains in the leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, trade, transportation and utilities industries.

A Bradenton, Florida, hoarding situation led to the discovery of over 100 floppy-eared bunnies, which are now up for adoption at the local animal shelter. Hans Wohlgefahrt, the communications coordinator for Manatee County Animal Welfare, told Fox News Digital that 69 rabbits were found alive inside a Bradenton home, while 32 were deceased. The conditions inside the home were not the best, he said, and it seemed like things got out of control, as rabbits can reproduce very quickly. When the matter was reported, Wohlgefahrt and others responded, along with police, who ultimately took the rabbits from the home on Feb. 1.

(Manatee County Animal Welfare) But even though the rabbits were taken from the home, Animal Welfare did not have custody of them until weeks later. Seventeen of the female rabbits were pregnant, and during the waiting period for gaining custody, medical staff could not treat them for anything other than life-threatening conditions. That meant sterilizations could not be provided. Several mothers ultimately gave birth to litters consisting of eight or more babies, bumping the number of rabbits in the shelter to well over 100.

Three Georgia agencies that provide social services are being sued in federal court by families who say their children's mental health disorders worsened from being institutionalized for prolonged periods as the state failed to provide adequate at-home services. The lawsuit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court says the state's shortcomings violate federal law including provisions of the Medicaid Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. It asks a judge to order the agencies to make improvements to its mental health care system. \"Georgia\u2019s children belong at home with their families,\" said Ruby Moore, executive director of the nonprofit Georgia Advocacy Office, which represents the families suing the state. \"Due to Georgia\u2019s failings, children are unnecessarily thrust into institutions and child welfare.\" GEORGIA CONSERVATIVE GROUP CLEARED OF VOTING RIGHTS ACT VIOLATION ACCUSATIONS The lawsuit names as defendants the leaders of three Georgia agencies \u2014 the Department of Community Health, the Department of Human Services and the Department of Behavioral Health and Developmental Disabilities. Each of the agencies declined comment, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, alleges that the state's actions violate federal laws, including provisions of the Medicaid Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. (Fox News) The lawsuit says the child plaintiffs have spent long periods institutionalized, leading to worsening symptoms and more frequent trips to hospital emergency rooms and psychiatric care facilities. It says one of the children has been institutionalized 16 times and admitted to emergency rooms 18 times, in part because the state failed to provide sufficient home care.

A Pennsylvania man who authorities say killed his girlfriend in a Nevada desert has been convicted. A jury in U.S. District Court in Nevada on Wednesday found John Matthew Chapman, 44, guilty of one count of kidnapping resulting in death, court records show. He faces life in prison at a sentencing hearing scheduled for Aug. 2. NEVADA COUPLE ACCUSED OF LOCKING AUTISTIC SON, 11, IN 'MAKESHIFT JAIL CELL': REPORT Authorities did not release the woman\u2019s name. They say that after killing her in September 2019, Chapman pretended to be her on her Facebook messenger account and lived at her residence. John Chapman has been convicted in connection with his girlfriend's death in the Nevada desert. (Fox News) The woman's neighbors in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, became suspicious when they hadn\u2019t seen her or her vehicle for months but saw Chapman around the house, prosecutors said. Police conducted a welfare check and found identification cards with Chapman\u2019s name and photo, the victim\u2019s cellphone, zip ties and a roll of duct tape, they said. Chapman admitted leading the woman to believe the two were taking a road trip to Las Vegas for a photo shoot, prosecutors said. Instead, they said, he brought her to a Nevada desert, tied her up and suffocated her. They added that he admitted killing her for her money.

        "text": "Games\nThe state saw an 85 percent drop in food stamp recipients After the food stamp rolls swelled for years under the Obama administration, fresh figures show a dramatic reduction in states that recently have moved to restore work requirements. States were allowed to waive those rules for able-bodied adults thanks to the 2009 economic stimulus. As the rules loosened and the economy sputtered out of the recession, food stamp enrollment soared to record levels \u2013 peaking at nearly 48 million nationwide in 2013. But while that number has dipped gradually in recent years, some states have moved aggressively to push recipients who can work back into the job market and, in due time, off the program. Alabama began 2017 by requiring able-bodied adults without children in 13 counties to either find a job or participate in work training as a condition for continuing to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits. SEATTLE MINIMUM WAGE HIKE HURTING WORKERS? According to AL.com, the number of those recipients declined from 5,538 to 831 between Jan. 1 and the beginning of May \u2013 an 85 percent drop. Similar changes were implemented in select counties in Georgia and by the end of the first three months, the number of adults receiving benefits in three participating counties dropped 58 percent, according to the\u00a0Georgia Public Policy Foundation. 'Welfare was never intended to be a one-way handout, but a program based on the idea of reciprocity.' The\u00a0Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently\u00a0reported\u00a0that in 21 additional counties that restored the work requirement, there was a 62 percent drop in SNAP participants. \u201cWork requirements have been enormously successful at reducing the number of people on food stamps. And while they made sense in the early part of the recession when unemployment was higher, that is no longer the case,\u201d said Robert Doar, a fellow in poverty studies at the American Enterprise Institute. A key component of the 1996 welfare reform bill, the work requirement applies to able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWD) between the ages of 18 to 49. However, as part of his 2009 economic stimulus, then-President Barack Obama allowed states to waive SNAP work requirements, which resulted in the number of ABAWDs on food stamps more than doubling from 1.9 million in 2008 to 3.9 million in 2010, according to a 2012 Congressional Research Service\u00a0study. The number continued to rise but has since slipped to roughly 4.2 million. According to the USDA, most states still offer full or partial waivers.  Advocates for waivers argue that the flexibility is needed to help people get back on their feet in the wake of the economic crisis. And a call in the Trump administration\u2019s budget to resurrect the work mandate and scale back SNAP\u2019s budget has drawn fire from anti-hunger advocates. \u201cParents will work just as hard at unforgiving jobs and see less food on the table for their families. Children will become sicker without the proper nutrition, ending up in hospitals or on the rolls of what social services remain. Some children will die,\u201d Mariana Chilton, a professor of public health at Drexel University,\u00a0predicted\u00a0in a column for The Hill. SNAP reform, however, could be bolstered by the developments at the state level. \u201cWelfare was never intended to be a one-way handout, but a program based on the idea of reciprocity,\u201d said Robert Rector, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. \u201cThose who receive benefits from the government should be required to work or participate in work-training as a condition.\u201d Doar and Rector cite reforms made by Republican Gov. Paul LePage of Maine. In October 2014, LePage announced that able-bodied adults would have to find work, spend 20 hours per week in a work program, or perform community service for six hours a week. Food stamp participation declined 14.5 percent from 235,771 in January 2014 to 201,557 in January 2015,\u00a0according to the state. An analysis of a group of 7,000 Mainers who left SNAP in 2014 found their total earnings increased from $3.85 million in the third quarter 2014 to $8.24 million in the last quarter of 2015. Kansas saw a 75 percent decline after implementing work requirements in 2013. In addition, nearly 60 percent of former beneficiaries found employment within 12 months and their incomes rose by an average of 127 percent per year, according to the\u00a0Foundation for Government Accountability. The Maine model taken nationwide could save taxpayers over $8.4 billion per year, according to Rector. That is the goal of Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who have introduced a bill to require able-bodied adults without children to participate in \u201cwork activation\u201d initiatives as a condition of their benefits. It also imposes time limits on SNAP participation. \u201cWe should be incentivizing work, not providing a disincentive to find a job, which is a good thing both for the taxpayer as well as for the beneficiary,\u201d Jordan said. Jordan told Fox News he speaks with business owners in his district every day who cannot find workers to fill open positions. \u201cThe focus of these programs should be on how we can help adults get their families to a better way of life,\u201d Jordan said.

This is the sixth story in a series about the open-air drug market in Kensington. Read the first, second, third, fourth and fifth parts. PHILADELPHIA \u2013 Giving food and providing other services to drug users in Kensington, a well-known open-air drug market in the City of Brotherly Love, only encourages dealers and perpetuates addiction, a local activist told Fox News. \"The best way I can describe Kensington is it's a war zone,\" Dennis Payne said. \"Kensington was given to the wolves, and the wolves are running with it. Payne spoke in front of McPherson Square, locally known as \"Needle Point Park, where everything drug-related is taking place.\" The activist started the EyE of Kensington Facebook group, which acts as a sort of message board for the neighborhood. WATCH MORE FOX NEWS DIGITAL ORIGINALS HERE \"It's a dead land,\" Payne said. \"There's no good anything here anymore in Kensington. It's all slowly dying.\" The community has become internationally known for its rampant open-air drug use and sales. The sidewalks are lined with addicts doped up and sprawled out, needles lining the concrete. \"Most people in this area have some kind of mental [or] physical [disability] or drug addiction,\" Payne told Fox News. \"What you're seeing is the results of a very rough life.\" But the activist believes much of the welfare, like food handouts, encourages more drug use. Dennis Payne, a Kensington activist, fears that feeding addicts is only encouraging more drug use in the neighborhood. (Fox News) PHILADELPHIA MAYOR CANDIDATE: \u2018I WOULD SHUT DOWN KENSINGTON,\u2019 CLEAR DRUGS AND CRIME \"By feeding these people, you're giving the other people cover to do their thing, to keep these people addicted,\" Payne said. \"And that's the system that's got to stop. There's got to be some kind of break in the system.\" \"These guys are the guys, for youse Christians, you're supposed to be out here getting them shelter, not giving them a tuna fish sandwich,\" he added. Payne also said services in Kensington attract more addicts since they see they can receive local welfare, freeing up whatever money they can scrape together for open-air drug purchases and use. \"They see all the services coming here,\" he told Fox News. \"So they migrate here.\" Addicts line a wall in Kensington. One sways as seems to struggle to remain standing. (Fox News Digital) PHILADELPHIA'S OPEN-AIR DRUG MARKET IS \u2018A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY,\u2019 FORMER RESIDENT AND ADDICT SAYS \"They need to be taken care of and taken off the streets,\" Payne continued. \"There's no reason for somebody who's mentally and physically disabled to be out here doing drugs.\" And addicts aren\u2019t the only ones suffering in Kensington. Payne pointed to the crimes addicts commit to \"get the money to get the drugs.\" \"They're breaking all kinds of laws,\" he said. \"I don't need to tell you what they're doing. Just look at our police logs.\" Kensington had among of the worst violent crime and drug crime rates in the city over a 30-day period ending April 24, according to data compiled by The Philadelphia Inquirer. A vape and rubber ties lie next to a passed out addict. The cap to a needle can also be seen. All are common sights in Kensington.

Meanwhile, crime and rampant drug use aside, Kensington is still a neighborhood like any other with families who live, work and play in the community. \"There's children that live there that have to walk over bodies to go catch the bus, to go to school, to go to the library,\" Frank Rodriguez, a recovering addict and former Kensington resident, previously told Fox News. \"There's people that are hostage in their own homes in that community.\" Opioid overdose kits containing naloxone \u2014 commonly referred to as Narcan, its \u2014 hang from a metal support in Kensington.

        "text": "Games\nRachel Dolezal is pictured in March 2017, six months after she changed her name to Nkechi Diallo. (AP Photo/Nicholas K. Geranios, File) Former Spokane NAACP President Nkechi Diallo -- who became infamous as Rachel Dolezal, a white woman identifying as black -- was booked and fingerprinted at a Washington state jail Monday as she awaits trial on multiple charges, including welfare fraud. Diallo pleaded not guilty to state charges of first-degree theft by welfare fraud, making false verification and second-degree perjury last month. A judge ordered her freed on her own recognizance and gave her a deadline of Monday evening to report to the Spokane County jail for booking and fingerprinting. Diallo, who changed her name from Rachel Dolezal in October 2016, is accused of receiving more than $8,800 in food and childcare assistance illegally between August 2015 and November 2017. RACHEL DOLEZAL HIT WITH FELONY THEFT CHARGE IN WELFARE FRAUD CASE The welfare fraud case started in March 2017 after a state investigator received information that Diallo had written a book --her autobiography, \"In Full Color.\" The investigator reviewed Diallo's records and found that she had been reporting her income as usually less than $500 per month, court documents said. However, a subpoena of her bank statements and other records showed Diallo had deposited nearly $84,000 into her account from 2015-17, without reporting most of it to the state Department of Social and Health Services. The money came from book sales, speaking engagements, soap making, doll making and the sale of her art, according to the case file. Diallo did report a change of circumstance to the state agency, saying she did a one-time job in October 2017 worth $20,000, court documents show. Rachel Dolezal, as she was known then, achieved international infamy in June 2015 after her parents, with whom she has long feuded, told reporters their daughter was white but was presenting herself as a black activist. She has said that she grew up near Troy, Mont., and started to change her perspective as a teenager, after her religious parents adopted four black children. She decided some years later that she would identify publicly as black. In addition to resigning as Spokane NAACP president, she was kicked off a police oversight commission, lost a position as a freelance columnist for a weekly newspaper in Spokane and was fired from her job teaching African studies at nearby Eastern Washington University.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A local news outlet that helped expose a wide-reaching public corruption scandal has filed its first defense against a defamation lawsuit brought by former Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant, with the news outlet arguing it engaged in constitutionally protected speech. In Mississippi Today's first legal response since Bryant sued the outlet and its CEO in the Circuit Court of Madison County on July 26 for allegedly defaming him in public comments on the misspending of $77 million of federal welfare funds, attorney Henry Laird outlined on Friday 19 legal defenses against the former governor's claims. The attorney also requested that the ex-governor's complaint be dismissed. \"We will vigorously defend this case and ensure the people of Mississippi that the press will not be intimidated,\" said Mississippi Today CEO Mary Margaret White in a statement. \"We stand for press freedom and will always uphold our mission of building a more informed Mississippi.\" DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WITHDRAWS FROM MISSISSIPPI SECRETARY OF STATE RACE DUE TO HEALTH ISSUES In addition to free speech protections, Mississippi Today's legal defense is built around New York Times Co. v. Sullivan., a 1964 decision in which the U.S. Supreme Court greatly limited the ability of public officials to sue for defamation. It ruled that news outlets are protected against a libel judgment unless it can be proven that they published with \"actual malice\" \u2014 knowing that something was false or acting with a \"reckless disregard\" to whether or not it was true. Bryant's July 26 lawsuit came just over two months after Mississippi Today and one of its reporters, Anna Wolfe, won a Pulitzer Prize for her coverage of the misspending of welfare funds intended for poor Mississippians that were instead diverted to the rich and powerful. Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant is shown during an interview on Jan. 8, 2020, in his office at the state Capitol in Jackson, Mississippi. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis, File) Prosecutors have said the state\u2019s human services department gave money to nonprofit organizations that spent it on projects such as a $5 million volleyball facility at the University of Southern Mississippi \u2014 a project for which retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre agreed to raise money. MULLEN AUTOMOTIVE'S NEW ELECTRIC CAR FACTORY IN MISSISSIPPI MARKS MILESTONE WITH DEBUT OF CLASS 3 EV TRUCK Mississippi Auditor Shad White announced in February 2020 that criminal charges were brought against six people, including John Davis, a former Mississippi Department of Human Services executive director who had been chosen by Bryant. The announcement came weeks after Bryant, a Republican, finished his second and final term as governor. Davis and others have pleaded guilty. Wolfe\u2019s \"The Backchannel\" series shed light on the embezzlement scheme, winning a Pulitzer in May. An article published on Mississippi Today\u2019s website announcing the honor said the outlet revealed how Bryant \"used his office to steer the spending of millions of federal welfare dollars\" to \"benefit his family and friends.\" That announcement \u2014 and an earlier report Mississippi Today published on the impact of its coverage \u2014 are the two primary written communications Bryant says are defamatory. Also at the center of his lawsuit are comments White made at a journalism conference that, according to Bryant's attorney William Quin II, misrepresented Bryant\u2019s connection to the squandered welfare dollars. In a May 11 letter, Bryant said White made a \"false and defamatory\" statement about him when, at a journalism conference in February, she said Mississippi Today broke the story that Bryant \"embezzled\" welfare money. No criminal charges have been filed against Bryant, and he has said he told the auditor in 2019 about possible misspending of money from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families antipoverty program. Reached by phone Monday, Quin said Mississippi Today's response \"speaks for itself\" and declined to comment further. In an amended complaint filed on Aug. 24, Quin listed nine unnamed clients from whom he claims Bryant lost almost $500,000 in business due to White's comments at the Knight Media Forum in February. Bryant joined a private consulting firm shortly after leaving public office. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Mississippi Today published an apology from White in May, a week after Bryant threatened a lawsuit, but his attorneys have said the apology wasn't specific enough. Favre also has not been charged with a crime, but the Mississippi Department of Human Services, with a new director, filed a civil lawsuit last year against him, along with more than three dozen other people and businesses, to try to recover more than $20 million of the misspent welfare money. Among the defendants in that civil suit is Nancy New, an ex-nonprofit head who pleaded guilty in April 2022 to state charges of misusing welfare money. On Friday, the same day Mississippi Today filed its response to Bryant's lawsuit, New's attorneys, Gerald and Carroll Bufkin, filed a motion to quash a subpoena by the former governor. Bryant\u2019s subpoena purports to seek documents relevant to his defamation suit, the Bufkins said. But as a public figure, Bryant must prove that Mississippi Today and White acted with \"actual malice\" when they made their allegedly defamatory statements, they argued, referring to the New York Times Co. v. Sullivan legal standard. The former governor \"has no legitimate basis\" for believing his subpoena could uncover relevant information, they argued.

A judge convicted a former state child welfare worker Friday of child endangerment in connection with the 2019 beating death of a 5-year-old suburban Chicago boy by his mother, but the judge acquitted the man's supervisor. Lake County Judge George Strickland found Carlos Acosta, 57 of Woodstock, who was a case investigator for the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, guilty of the child endangerment charge but acquitted him of a reckless conduct charge, news outlets reported. Strickland said he could not find Acosta\u2019s supervisor, Andrew Polovin, 51, of Island Lake, guilty of either charge because he did not know how much Polovin knew about the abuse of the boy, Andrew \"AJ\" Freund of Crystal Lake. AJ died in April 2019 after being beaten by his mother. JoAnn Cunningham. She is serving a 35-year sentence for his murder. The boy\u2019s father, Andrew Freund Sr., was sentenced to 30 years in prison for covering up the murder by burying the boy\u2019s body in a field.

Polovin\u2019s attorney, Matthew McQuaid, said he and his client were \"grateful\" for the verdict. \"I never thought he committed a crime,\" McQuaid said. He said Polovin, who was fired by the state, now works in a different field. Authorities said Cunningham killed AJ on April 15, 2019, after she became angry about soiled underwear that he had tried to hide. She forced the boy to stand in a cold shower for at least 20 minutes, hit him in the head with the shower head, and then put him to bed cold, wet and naked, authorities said.

(AP) \u2014 West Virginia's unemployed people will need to do more to prove they are searching for jobs to collect state benefits under a new law that will take effect later this year. A controversial bill passed by the GOP-majority Legislature on the final day of the 60-day legislative session went into law without Republican Gov. Jim Justice's signature Thursday. Justice did not comment on why he didn't sign or veto the bill before the midnight deadline. SMOKING WITH KIDS IN CAR NOW ILLEGAL UNDER WEST VIRGINIA LAW The legislation contains provisions that will go into effect July 1 requiring that people receiving unemployment benefits in the state must complete at least four work-search activities a week. Those activities could include applying for jobs or taking a civil service examination. The new law, which passed on Thursday without Republican Gov. Jim Justice's signature, requires West Virginia\u2019s unemployed people to do more to prove they are looking for jobs in order to collect state benefits. (AP Photo/Chris Jackson) The law also freezes the rates people receiving unemployment benefits are paid at the current maximum of $622 a week, instead of a system adjusting with inflation. People also would be able to work part time while receiving unemployment and searching for full-time work. Current average benefits are around $420 a week. Those in support of the measure said they were concerned about the long-term solvency of the state's unemployment trust fund. Others said the fund is doing well and that they didn't understand why the move was necessary. Speaking on the House floor March 9, Democratic Del. Shawn Fluharty said he didn't like the message the legislation sends. \"Here we are, just year in and year out, finding ways to chip away at who actually built this state: the blue-collar worker,\" Fluharty said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The legislation ultimately passed was a compromise between the House of Delegates and the Senate. An earlier version of the bill passed by the Senate would have drawn back benefit coverage from 26 to 24 weeks. Under the Senate bill, an unemployed person would have started by receiving weekly checks amounting to $712 \u2014 an increase from the current maximum rate of $662 \u2014 or 70% of their original wage. Those checks would have been reduced by 5% every four weeks until the fourth sixth-week period, when the checks would amount to 45% of a person's original wage.

Cops responded to Marilyn Manson's Los Angeles home on Wednesday to conduct a welfare check amid his ongoing abuse scandal. Photos surfaced early Thursday showing a police presence outside of the embattled rocker's Studio City mansion. A spokesperson confirmed to Fox News that, while they cannot verify the owner of the residence, police did respond to a welfare check in the same neighborhood Manson\u00a0reportedly lives in. \"On February 3, 2021, just after 6:00 p.m., LAPD North Hollywood Area officers responded to a 'Welfare Check'\u00a0in the 3400 block of Troy Drive in Studio City,\" the LAPD confirmed to Fox News in a statement. TMZ, who first reported the incident, said the welfare check was conducted after one of Manson's pals grew concerned about his wellbeing after they could not get in touch with him.\u00a0 MARILYN MANSON SPEAKS OUT FOLLOWING ABUSE ALLEGATIONS: 'HORRIBLE DISTORTIONS' Upon their arrival officers \"determined there was no evidence of any trouble\" and \"no report was taken,\" the police department said. Dita Von Teese and Marilyn Manson were previously married. Teese spoke out amid Manson's abuse scandal this week. She claimed she did not experience abuse but voiced support for alleged victims who have come forward with claims. (Richard Lewis/WireImage) The welfare check comes as allegations of abuse continue to pile up against the shock rocker. These claims began on Monday after actress\u00a0Evan Rachel Wood\u00a0published accusations on Instagram Monday morning, alleging the rocker \"brainwashed and manipulated\" her during their relationship. Wood reportedly met Manson when she was 18 and he was 36. Wood's claims on Monday led an additional four\u00a0women to speak out with accusations they endured \"sexual assault, psychological abuse, and/or various forms of coercion, violence, and intimidation\" from Manson,\u00a0Vanity Fair\u00a0reported. MARILYN MANSON 'IMMEDIATELY' DROPPED FROM RECORD LABEL FOLLOWING ABUSE ALLEGATIONS Marilyn Manson denied allegations of abuse made by Evan Rachel Wood this week. The celebrities were engaged in 2010. (John Shearer/WireImage/Getty Images) Manson, whose real name is Brian Warner,\u00a0has\u00a0denied Wood\u2019s allegations. \"Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,\" \"The Beautiful People\" musician said in a statement on Instagram. \"My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners.\" \"Obviously, my art and my life have long been magnets for controversy, but these recent claims about me are horrible distortions of reality,\"\u00a0he said. \"My intimate relationships have always been entirely consensual with like-minded partners.\" \"Regardless of how - and why - others are now choosing to misrepresent the past, that is the truth,\" Manson concluded. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER Manson's Jenna Jameson this week claimed that while her previous sexual experiences with Manson were consensual, she ended the relationship after the musician allegedly voiced his fantasy about burning her alive. A stylist named Love Bailey also spoke to Fox News this week about an alleged experience that took place at the rocker's home in 2011 that resulted in him holding a gun to her head. Manson's ex-wife\u00a0Dita Von Teese\u00a0also broke her silence. She said she was not abused by Manson but expressed sympathy for his alleged victims. \"Abuse of any kind has no place in any relationship,\" the dancer said. \"I urge those of you who have incurred abuse to take steps to heal and the strength to fully realize yourself.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Manson has since been\u00a0dropped from his record label.

A Texas man who agreed to surrender on charges for taking part in the U.S. Capitol riot fired a gun toward sheriff's deputies who went to his house later that day in response to a welfare call, federal prosecutors said Thursday. Nathan Donald Pelham, 40, allegedly fired the shots from his rural home on April 12, the same day he was told he was charged with four misdemeanors for allegedly participating in the Jan. 6 attack. Officers heard bullets \"whiz\" past them and hit objects nearby, according to an affidavit from an FBI agent. The deputies left without making an arrest, according to court records. The Justice Department said no law enforcement officers were injured. An attorney for Pelham, who was arrested Tuesday, did not immediately return a message seeking comment. TENNESSEE MOTHER, SON WHO BROUGHT ZIP-TIES INTO SENATE GALLERY ON JAN. 6 CONVICTED The episode is an outlier in the more than 1,000 federal arrests that have been made in the Jan. 6 riot. Practically all of the arrests have been made without incident, including those of members of far-right extremist groups facing serious felony charges such as seditious conspiracy. A Texas man who reportedly fired a gun at police had just hours earlier surrendered on charges that he participated in the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File) Investigators say Pelham entered the Capitol wearing goggles and a hat with the logo of the Proud Boys extremist group, but later denied affiliation with them. He allegedly stayed inside the Capitol for about seven minutes. About two months later, Pelham was stopped while attempting to enter Canada and told Border Patrol agents that he was at the Capitol on Jan. 6, court records show. ROMANCE NOVEL COVER MODEL GETS 3 YEARS FOR ROLE IN JAN. 6 RIOT Prosecutors say Pelham had agreed to surrender on the Capitol riot charges when he was contacted last week by an FBI agent. Later that day though, a deputy from the Hunt County Sheriff's Office was sent to the house in response to a welfare call made by a relative. A child was sent out of the house and deputies began to hear gun shots, according to court records. Pelham lives about 50 miles northeast of Dallas. Pelham was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, prosecutors said. In the case of another Jan. 6 defendant, a Tennessee man charged with assaulting an officer in the riot was later accused of conspiring with another person on a failed attempt to kill dozens of federal agents involved in the investigation.

Police have shot and wounded a Kansas woman who is suspected of fatally shooting her 14-year-old son, authorities said. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation announced Tuesday that the 43-year-old woman is expected to survive. She was shot early Monday after hours of negotiations. Officers went to an apartment Sunday night after the father of Claude Hodges called to request a welfare check because the teen had not shown up at a designated exchange spot and could not be reached, authorities said. THREE KANSAS CITY POLICE OFFICERS WOUNDED IN SHOOTING DURING UNDERCOVER FENTANYL INVESTIGATION No one answered the door, police said. But when officers noticed a bullet hole in the apartment's exterior wall, they obtained a key and went inside. The woman was holding a handgun with a shotgun nearby, so officers quickly left, the KBI said in a news release. After negotiations, the woman exited the apartment but later picked up her handgun and advanced towards officers, prompting them to fire.  After several hours of negotiations, the woman exited the apartment. Initially she left her handgun on the ground. But the KBI said she picked it up around 1:40 a.m. Monday and began to walk toward the officers while pointing it in their direction. The KBI said two SWAT officers from the Wichita police department each fired one shot, striking the woman. She was rushed rushed to a hospital, where she underwent surgery and is expected to survive, the KBI said. KANSAS CITY MAN CHARGED FOR SHOOTING BLACK TEEN THROUGH HIS FRONT DOOR: PROSECUTOR Inside the apartment, officers found Hodges dead from a gunshot wound, police and the KBI said.

A child welfare agency in Pennsylvania failed to protect children from horrific abuse and neglect, allowing them to languish for years in homes overtaken by animal waste and garbage, a prosecutor said Tuesday as he announced criminal charges against five caseworkers. Three caseworkers and two supervisors at Lackawanna County\u2019s Office of Youth and Family Services in Scranton were arrested on felony charges of child endangerment and failing to report abuse, days after state authorities downgraded the county agency\u2019s license. The caseworkers knew that children were living in dangerous, deplorable conditions, but \"instead of coming to the rescue, they chose to walk away,\" said District Attorney Mark Powell. In some cases, he said, the workers \"falsified reports to make it seem like everything was OK when they knew it wasn\u2019t.\" A Lackawanna County spokesperson declined to comment on the allegations \u2014 which involve eight children in three households \u2014 or whether any reforms were planned at the child welfare agency. FLORIDA COUPLE ARRESTED IN \u2018BONE CHILLING\u2019 CHILD ABUSE CASE, SPECIAL NEEDS 3-YEAR-OLD 'ROTTING IN BED': POLICE In one case, police went to a house for a report of loose dogs and found what court documents described as a house of horrors: Broken windows, piles of junk, swarms of mites or fleas, walls and floors covered in animal feces and urine, and an \"overwhelming smell of feces, rotten garbage, fly activity, and decay\" that required an officer to use a respirator. The children in the home, ages 9 and 10, were underfed, covered in flea bites and slept on the floor without a pillow or blankets. The younger child was not toilet trained, according to court documents. The mother said she knew she was failing to provide a safe home for her children \u2014 and told police she'd repeatedly and fruitlessly begged the Office of Youth and Family Services for help, according to a police affidavit. Five child welfare agency employees in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, were arrested after failing to protect children from horrible abuse and neglect. (FOX News) She was \"desperately seeking help, tools, treatment, and services, which never came,\" police said. Last week, following an annual inspection, the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services downgraded the county\u2019s license to provisional status and ordered it to submit a plan of correction. In response to the state inspection, the Office of Youth and Family Services tried to shift blame to Scranton police, whom the agency accused of running a \"questionably motivated criminal investigation\" into its practices. TEXAS MAN SENTENCED TO 45 YEARS IN PRISON FOR CONTINUOUS SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILD \"Bad actors in the police department are routinely using threats and intimidation\" to investigate the child welfare agency, county officials said in their formal response. \"The investigation\u2019s primary outcome appears to be the denigration and defamation of both individuals in the agency as well as the entire mission, vision, and practice of the agency.\" A message was left with Scranton Police Chief Thomas Carroll seeking a response to the agency's claims. The county agency also blamed staff shortages for some of the problems, saying it was trying to increase its ranks and take other steps to address the shortcomings identified in the state inspection. Powell, the district attorney, said a lack of staff had nothing to do with the criminal behavior of some of the agency's employees. \"The children in these cases didn\u2019t fall through the cracks because OYFS was understaffed. These cases were on the agency\u2019s radar for a long time,\" said Powell, adding that referrals had come from neighbors, landlords, teachers, code inspectors, medical professionals and others. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He said the abuse and neglect that children suffered because of the agency's indifference was \"heartbreaking and unacceptable.\" The defendants were identified as Randy Ramik, 59, of Clarks Green; Bryan Walker, 51, of Eynon; Erik Krauser, 45, of Dickson City; Sadie O'Day, 34, of Scranton; and Amy Helcoski, 50, of Scranton. Each defendant was freed on $20,000 unsecured bail with an order to return to court next month. Court documents did not list attorneys for any of the defendants. A woman who answered the phone at a number for Ramik hung up on a reporter. The other defendants could not be reached.

Thousands of Alaskans who depend on government assistance have waited months for food stamp benefits, exacerbating a long-standing hunger crisis worsened by the pandemic, inflation and the remnants of a typhoon that wiped out stockpiles of fish and fishing equipment. The backlog, which began last August, is especially concerning in a state where communities in far-flung areas, including Alaska Native villages, are often not connected by roads. They must have food shipped in by barge or airplane, making the cost of even basic goods exorbitant. Around 13% of the state's roughly 735,000 residents received Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits \u2014 or SNAP \u2014 in July, before the troubles began. \"People are struggling and having to make choices of getting food or getting heating fuel,\" said Daisy Lockwood Katcheak, city administrator in Stebbins, an Alaska Native village of 634 people, more than 400 miles northwest of Anchorage. BIDEN BROKE OUR WELFARE SYSTEM. HE NEEDS TO STOP PAYING PEOPLE FOR NOT WORKING Faced with food shortages and rampant inflation, the city recently used $38,000 in funds raised for a children's spring carnival to buy residents basic supplies. The community on Alaska's western coast is also reeling from the remnants of a typhoon that destroyed a critical stockpile of fish and fishing boats at the same time problems with the food stamp program were emerging. \"My people are suffering first hand,\" said Katcheak. Alaska lawmakers have responded to the state's sluggish response, as lawsuits have alleged failures in the state's administration of the food stamps and a program that provides aid to low-income Alaskans who are blind, elderly or have disabilities. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy authorized $1.7 million to provide relief to communities in a state that is almost 2 1/2 times the size of Texas. Lawmakers approved emergency funding to hire staff to handle the crush of cases as food banks have reported the highest level of demand they have seen. \"We know a lot of people that are not eating multiple meals a day; they\u2019ve drawn down to maybe a single meal,\" said Anthony Reinert, director of programs at the Food Bank of Alaska. There has always \"been a baseline of hunger in Alaska. But it\u2019s spread and expanded pretty significantly in the last six months.\" Rose Carney organizes supplies at the food pantry at Harvest Christian Fellowship Church in Alaska on April 17, 2023. Carney and thousands of Alaskans who depend on government assistance have not received food stamps for months.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Mark Thiessen) The hunger crisis in Alaska stems from a perfect storm of cascading events, compounded by staffing and technology issues within the state health department. During the pandemic, the regular renewal process for SNAP benefits \u2014 a federal program administered by states \u2014 was suspended. Problems emerged after the state ended its public health emergency last July and recertification requirements for SNAP were reinstituted, resulting in a flood of applications. A cyberattack that targeted the state health department in 2021 complicated Alaska's ability to process the applications, said Heidi Hedberg, who was appointed health commissioner late last year. Employees who were supposed to upgrade key department computer systems were pulled away to address the attack, leaving the upgrade work undone. But 100 positions that were set to be eliminated due to anticipated efficiencies with the upgrade nonetheless were still cut, Hedberg said. In January, the backlog of applicants seeking to renew food assistance benefits had reached a high of 9,104. Officials hope to clear the recertification backlog this month and turn their attention to thousands of new applications, according to the department. \"This is not how SNAP systems are supposed to work, period,\" said Nick Feronti, an attorney representing Alaskans who are suing over delays and other concerns with the food stamp program. BILL BARR SET TO BATTLE BIDEN\u2019S BUREAUCRACY THROUGH NEW LEGAL PROJECT FOCUSED ON \u2018EXCESSIVE REGULATION\u2019 Stephanie Duboc is still waiting for assistance after submitting her application in December. She volunteers at the Chugiak-Eagle River Food Pantry in suburban Anchorage, and said the food she receives from the pantry is essential. \"It would be a huge impact on my family financially,\" without that help, she said. Among those suing is Rose Carney, 68, who receives $172 a month in assistance. Carney said she received a letter in September saying her benefits had been renewed \u2014 but a month later, got another letter saying her application was due the next day. She filled it out but didn't start receiving benefits until last month after contacting a lawyer, she said. Meanwhile, she added water to stretch bean soup and visited a church food pantry to get by. \"I was really upset because that was like income that I was depending on, even though it was just food stamps,\" said Carney. Feronti, her attorney, has 10 clients seeking class-action status, but the case has been on hold as the parties work toward a possible resolution that could compel long-term changes. The National Center for Law and Economic Justice, also involved in the case, has filed a similar lawsuit in Missouri, but Alaska's situation is \"in the extreme,\" said Saima Akhtar, an attorney with the center. The $1.7 million allocated by Dunleavy in February was for the food banks to address urgent needs, including the bulk purchases of goods and distribution of cash cards so people in rural communities can buy groceries on their own and support local stores. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Reinert, with the food bank, said about $800,000 was used to buy staples like oatmeal, pasta, beans, canned fruit and shelf-stable cheese at cheaper prices in Washington state. The goods were then shipped to Alaska for distribution. Those supplies are beginning to reach the most needy communities, where the cost of groceries in the store are astronomically high due to the logistics of getting them there. In Bethel, a hub community in southwest Alaska, the Bethel Community Services Foundation provides food to about 350 households a month \u2014 nearly six times as many as before the pandemic. Milk at the store costs about $12.50 a gallon, while a 20-pound bag of rice is $62.49 and a 40-pound bag of a discount brand of dog food is $82.49, said Carey Atchak, the foundation's food security coordinator.

The United Nations is once again under the microscope for blaming Israel for an attack on a compound as it opts to curb its footprint in Gaza, according to the world body. The spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio\u00a0Guterres issued a statement noting the U.N. had \"taken the difficult decision to reduce the Organization\u2019s footprint in Gaza\" even as \"humanitarian needs soar.\"\u00a0 U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric claimed that \"information currently available\" indicated that a strike on the U.N.\u2019s Deir al Balah compound on March 19 was \"caused by an Israeli tank.\" One U.N. employee was killed in the incident, and six others were wounded, Dujarric said.\u00a0 DOGE USAID BUDGET HIT UN IN \u2018WORST LIQUIDITY CRISIS SINCE ITS ESTABLISHMENT\u2019 U.N. headquarters in New York City on Aug. 21, 2014. (iStock) On the date of the incident, the Israel Defense Forces Tweeted that \"contrary to reports, the IDF did not strike a U.N. compound in Deir el Balah.\" The IDF asked media outlets \"to act with caution regarding unverified reports.\" The IDF told Fox News Digital Monday that the U.N.'s claim was \"absolutely not accurate.\"\u00a0 While his statement named Israel, it stopped short in naming the terrorist group Hamas or other extremist groups operating in Gaza. \"The location of this U.N. compound was well known to the parties to the conflict,\" Dujarric continued. \"I reiterate that all parties to the conflict are bound by international law to protect the absolute inviolability of U.N. premises. Without this, our colleagues face intolerable risks as they work to save the lives of civilians.\" Dujarric added that the \"Secretary-General\u00a0strongly condemns\u00a0these strikes and demands\u00a0a full, thorough and independent investigation on this incident.\" PAUSE IN US FOREIGN AID HAS UN IN PANIC OVER FUNDING CUTS, TRUMP SAYS WORLD BODY \u2018NOT BEING WELL RUN\u2019 Israeli troops deployed to Gaza.

Yet the U.N. is quick to publish another baseless slander against Israel. No standards, no professionalism - nothing stands in the way of the U.N. Secretary General in another attempt to smear Israel.\"\u00a0 Foundation for Defense of Democracies research analyst Joe Truzman told Fox News Digital that Dujarric\u2019s statement gave the \"impression\u2026 that the United Nations has deliberately avoided criticizing Hamas and the other Palestinian terrorist groups in Gaza for fear of creating friction with the armed groups. This failed strategy has only emboldened Hamas and its allies, allowing them to exploit UNRWA facilities in Gaza with impunity. Time and again, authorities have uncovered terrorist infrastructure connected to UNRWA facilities, including agency employees who were members of terrorist groups and committed atrocities on October 7.\" On March 23, the IDF killed Hamas political bureau member Ismail Barhoum while he was purportedly operating out of Nassar Hospital in Khan Younis, Gaza. After media outlets, including Al Jazeera, claimed that Barhoum was being treated at the hospital, IDF international spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani Tweeted that Barhoum had \"held meetings with other terrorists and senior figures in the terrorist organization\" while remaining \"in the hospital for many weeks.\" AT LEAST 19 KILLED IN ISRAELI STRIKES IN GAZA, INCLUDING SENIOR HAMAS LEADER U.N. and the World Health Organization vehicles wait to enter the Gaza Strip with aid intended for hospitals on April 25, 2024.

In a tactic he has \"witnessed for years,\" he said that \"Hamas and its allies deliberately embed themselves within civilian areas to evade detection.\"\u00a0 CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Israeli soldiers sit on a tank in the northern Gaza Strip on March 18, 2025.

Following a ceasefire and partial hostage exchange that saw 25 living and eight deceased hostages returned to Israel and almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners released, conflict has returned to Gaza. With support from the Trump White House, Israel cut humanitarian aid to Gaza earlier this month in order to pressure Hamas into an extension of the ceasefire, and to free the hostages.

They forced their way into the house and found the victim dead inside.\u00a0 Police obtained a search warrant and collected evidence that helped them find Reed at a Decatur hospital around 6:30 p.m., authorities said. Reed was treated for a cut on the hand and taken to the Sangamon County Jail, where bond for his release was set at $5 million on Wednesday morning. When asked why Silas was visiting the home alone and whether there was a suspected threat, Sangamon County State's Attorney Dan Wright said that responses \"are relevant enough to this investigation that it\u2019s not appropriate to answer those questions.\" MISSING NORTH CAROLINA GIRL, 3, FOUND SAFE; FATHER CHARGED WITH KILLING MOTHER Six children of undisclosed ages were present at the time of the incident, Campbell said, but he was unaware if they witnessed anything. They were in protective custody on Wednesday. Campbell said he believes Reed is related to one or more of the children and that several adults were living in the home, but he did not elaborate. Wright said conviction could put Reed in prison for life if a court finds the conduct in Silas' death \"exceptionally brutal, heinous and indicative of wanton cruelty.\" Silas had just joined the department in August after working in the behavioral health field for seven years at the Department of Juvenile Justice, according to a statement by Council 31 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which represents DCFS employees.

Montgomery soon collected welfare payments on behalf of the child, and his estranged wife was accused of continuing to receive them for months after Harmony was last seen alive. Kayla Montgomery is now cooperating with investigators in the murder case against her husband.

She has never been found, but police have accused her father of beating her to death and hiding her remains. (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children) A watchdog investigation last year found serious \"miscalculations\" in the family court system's decision to hand Harmony over to her father before her disappearance and presumed murder. The Millers are asking supporters to reach out to their state representatives and senators and urge them to vote in favor of H.4088 and S.118. \"We now live in Arlington, Virginia, and came back to Massachusetts to officially adopt Jamison at National Adoption Day in November of 2019,\" Blair Miller told the Massachusetts Senate's Joint Children, Families and Persons with Disabilities Committee at an hours-long hearing Tuesday.\u00a0 \"We now know that just days later, while we were celebrating Jamison's birthday back in Virginia, Harmony was being brutally beaten.

        "text": "Games\nFox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) \u2014 Twelve years after a hacker stole personal data from more than 3.6 million people in South Carolina by obtaining Social Security numbers and credit card information from tax returns, the state's top police officer said Wednesday he thought he knew who did it but wasn't ready to name anyone. State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel was careful not to release many details during his confirmation hearing for another six-year term. He said what authorities didn't find shows that the state had the right response after the U.S. Secret Service identified the hack and data breach in October 2012. RADIO STATIONS IN SEVERAL STATES SAY SIGNALS WERE HACKED WITH ANTI-TRUMP RAP \"I think the fact that we didn\u2019t come up with a whole lot of people\u2019s information that got breached is a testament to the work that people have done on this case,\" Keel said. State Law Enforcement Division Chief Mark Keel waits to answer questions at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, April 10, 2024, in Columbia, S.C.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Jeffrey Collins) A contractor with the state Department of Revenue clicked on a malicious link in an email in the summer of 2012, allowing a hacker to access 6.4 million state income tax returns. They collected the Social Security numbers of 3.6 million people and almost 400,000 credit and debit card numbers. The state paid $12 million for identity theft protection and credit monitoring for its residents after the breach, At the time, it was one of the largest breaches in U.S. history but has since been surpassed greatly by hacks to Equifax, Yahoo, Home Depot, Target and PlayStation. Democratic Sen. Brad Hutto has been searching for answers for over a decade and has been repeatedly told it was an active investigation and couldn't be talked about. Hutto decided to ask Keel about the breach Wednesday to try to get answers in public. \"Now you can tell us that y\u2019all paid somebody in Azerbaijan $28,000 or whatever it was,\" Hutto said. Keel refused again to say if South Carolina paid a ransom to the hacker to get the information back. \"I\u2019m probably still not going to be totally transparent with you, OK?\" Keel said. \"I\u2019m not going to lie to you either.\" Keel justified the insurance for taxpayers and the federal and state investigative work by saying the quick action prevented the hacked information from being used and the proof was what didn't happen \u2014 an onslaught of bogus credit card charges or people using stolen ID information. In retrospect, the state may not have had to spend $12 million on insurance. But that is with the benefit of hindsight, Keel said. \"We didn\u2019t really have a choice,\" Keel said. \"It was something that we had to do because at the time this happen we had to start trying to protect people immediately. We didn\u2019t have time for the investigation to play out the way it ultimately played out.\" Hutto responded: \"Did it play out? Do you know who did it?\" \"Yes, sir, I know who did it,\" Keel said, refusing to give any other details. Hutto asked if the person had been prosecuted, then laughed and said it might have been because the person was paid off. Keel didn't respond to the bait. \"If we could ever get to this individual, they may be,\" he said. The Senate subcommittee approved Keel's nomination for an additional six-year term. It now goes to the full Judiciary Committee. Keel has worked at the State Law Enforcement Division for nearly his entire 44-year law enforcement career, other than a three-year stint as the Department of Public Safety\u2019s director. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He rose through the ranks in jobs like helicopter pilot and hostage negotiator before becoming the agency's chief of staff in 2001. He spent a year as interim director in 2007 before being passed over by then-Gov. Mark Sanford for the top job. Gov. Nikki Haley chose Keel to lead the State Law Enforcement Division in 2011.

Ron DeSantis said that the state\u2019s unemployment system was deliberately designed to be tedious and \u201cnot user friendly\u201d. Over 4 million people applied for unemployment benefits in Florida by May, reported the Tampa Bay Times, but just six percent of Floridians had received any benefits from the state by the end of April. \u201cI mean having studied how it [the unemployment system] was internally constructed, I think the goal was for whoever designed, it was, \u2018Let\u2019s put as many kind of pointless roadblocks along the way, so people just say, oh, the hell with it, I\u2019m not going to do that\u2019,\u201d DeSantis told local a CBS news outlet Tuesday. FLORIDA TOPS 500,000 CORONAVIRUS CASES: HEALTH OFFICIALS The nearly $78 million online system was developed by Republican Sen. Rick Scott, and was allegedly designed to limit benefits and keep unemployment taxes paid by Florida businesses low. Politico reported that an estimated $2.3 billion would be saved between 2011 and 2020. The online unemployment program known as CONNECT, launched in 2013 while Scott, now a U.S. Senator, held the state\u2019s governor position. \u201cIt\u2019s a sh-- sandwich, and it was designed that way by Scott,\u201d a DeSantis advisor told Politico in April. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about saving money. It was about making it harder for people to get benefits or keep benefits so that the unemployment numbers were low to give the governor something to brag about.\u201d DeSantis openly criticized the program for the first time this week, though he did not place blame solely on Scott. DeSantis said he didn\u2019t know if Scott purposefully intended to deter people from filing for unemployment benefits, but added, \u201cIt was definitely done in a way to lead to the least number of claims being paid out.\u201d The program has been known to have basic issues such as frequently crashing and difficulty in submitting claims. \"A lot of these unemployment systems throughout the country, you know, weren't very good, but a lot of them were like 40, 50 years old,\" DeSantis\u00a0told\u00a0CBS4 in Miami. \"Ours wasn't really old. I mean, ours was really five, six years ago. And it should have been done better for that price tag to produce better results.\" The state\u2019s Senate Democratic Caucuas said Thursday that 1,461,763 Floridians are still waiting for payment.
